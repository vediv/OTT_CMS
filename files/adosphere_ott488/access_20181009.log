The new Ford Transit Custom PHEV has been revealed promising 30 miles of zero emissions range, with a claimed total range north of 300 with use of an on-board generator – a 1.0-litre EcoBoost engine. The front wheels are driven by an electric motor, which gets its power from a 14kWh liquid-cooled lithium-ion battery pack, which in turn gets its energy from either the mains, or by running the 1.0-litre engine. The PHEV will offer the same 1-tonne payload and load volume of a standard diesel powered Transit Custom. A charge port has been built into the front bumper, allowing the Custom PHEV to be recharged in five hours using a domestic 240-volt 10-amp power supply. This drops to three hours using a commercial 240 volt 16-amp or 32-amp supply.',

Almost 3,000 i30 N five-door hatchback units were sold in the first half of 2018 in Europe. 100 units of its First Edition sold out in Germany in just 48 hours. To reflect its sophisticated and hot character, the All-New i30 Fastback N has received many design features of its five-door hatchback sibling. On the exterior, the elegant i30 Fastback shape has been merged with the dynamic features of the i30 N five-door hatchback. As a result, the i30 Fastback N showcases a dynamic-looking N Grille and the N front bumper, as well as a unique rear bumper, both of which are highlighted by a red character line below. The black side sill of the lowered body further underlines the model’s sportiness. Moreover, the rear features the dual twin muffler exhaust and a generously arched rear spoiler that is integrated into the tailgate. To highlight the rear spoiler, a glossy black accent has been inserted to further emphasise the specific N appearance.',

After the restart, Ammermüller stuck close to the bumper of Preining’s 911. However, the German driver found no way past the Austrian to secure the lead spot. After 13 laps, 20-year-old Preining swept over the finish line as the winner 0.4 seconds ahead of Ammermüller. For the youngster, this marked his tenth victory in the Porsche Carrera Cup Deutschland. “Thomas Preining was so fast today that there was never really a chance for me to overtake him.
