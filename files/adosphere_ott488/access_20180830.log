The result is the I.D.

R Pikes Peak was a world first for us,” said Klaus Bischoff, Head of Volkswagen Design. “Our task was to transfer the unmistakable style of the I.D. family to such an extreme and emotional racing car. My whole team was motivated to the core by this unusual challenge.” The design development for the racing car participating in the “Unlimited” category started in October 2017 with the proverbial blank sheet of paper. In the initial briefing, Bischoff and his colleagues didn’t get much info from the engineers other than the desired length, width and height of the chassis of the I.D. R Pikes Peak. The physical conditions at Pikes Peak uniquely affect the design of the car, requiring collaboration between the design and engineering teams. Every element from the aerodynamics and the cooling system for the engine, to the batteries and brakes of the racing car needs to be able to cope with the unusual stresses of the thin mountain air—the starting line is located at an altitude just above 9,000 feet, with the finish at 14,115 feet above sea level.',

The most striking innovations inside the vehicle include the 11-inch touchscreen of the new Porsche Communication Management (PCM), re-designed and re-positioned air vents and the GT sports steering wheel familiar from the 911.

Thanks to this technology, the full range of vehicles, from MINI to Rolls-Royce, can now be quality-controlled even in the early stages of development. Scans are performed by four robots which move around the outside of the prototype to produce several thousand cross-sectional images. These are then used for detailed examinations of innovations, new materials and bonding technologies. Until now, vehicles have had to be dismantled for analysis, but CT allows checks to be carried out with the vehicle completely intact. The new X-ray system is based in the BMW Group Pilot Plant in the Research & Innovation Centre (FIZ) in Munich, at the intersection between Development and Production.\r\n\r\nUdo Hänle, head of Production Integration and Pilot Plant: “The use of this state-of-the-art computer tomography system is a major step forward for us as it will help us to improve the quality of our products even further. We can now analyse our prototypes in minute detail without having to dismantle them first. The new system allows us to examine our vehicles in a way that wouldn\'t be possible with conventional, static computer tomography systems. Ultimately, this will enable us to integrate new technologies into a series vehicles even faster.”',

The ambience that the brand aims to exude is initially characterised in terms of colour. A glowing, pulsating red, positioned to accentuate it against a dark backdrop, symbolises power, passion and performance. The materials used are distinguished by their authenticity and very consciously establish a link to the high-technology world of motor racing. The use of contrasts, too, such as smooth – rough, soft – hard, shiny – matt, serves to emphasise the performance aspirations of AMG. New highlights are set by the use of more refined materials revealing, for example, a marble-like structure, thereby conveying a powerful interpretation of the concept of luxury. Dynamic graphics, shapes and their proportions create a sense of speed and underscore the muscular beauty of the brand aesthetic.',
