The e-POWER system combines an electric motor, which drives the wheels, with a gasoline engine that charges the vehicle’s battery.\r\nBecause the wheels are driven by an electric motor, the e-POWER system treats drivers to the powerful, smooth acceleration of an all-electric vehicle, with torque delivery from the system surpassing that of a minivan with a 3.5-liter engine. Used solely to charge the battery, the gasoline engine runs at a constant, optimal speed for maximum fuel efficiency, achieving 26.2 km/L, No. 1 in its class.\r\nFun and comfortable to drive, the Serena e-POWER has been a hit in Japan. Since its launch, 40% of Serena buyers have chosen the e-POWER version. In addition to the system’s powerful acceleration, its e-POWER Drive mode offers the convenience of being able to speed up or decelerate by using only the accelerator pedal.Using the e-POWER Drive mode, stress is relieved as brake pedal application decreases by nearly 70%.',
