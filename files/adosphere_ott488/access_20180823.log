Yet, Mazda6 is also serene, thoroughly reworked underneath its sheet metal to deliver a refined experience befitting of a far more expensive car.\r\nThe 2016 Mazda CX-9 three-row crossover SUV was a remarkable step for Mazda. It once again elevated Mazda, showing if Mazda built an SUV with superior driving dynamics, class-above refinement, an abundance of amenities, technology and a strong engine, customers would come. After more than a year since going on sale, approximately 55 percent of all Mazda CX-9 crossover SUVs sold in the U.S. have been either high-level Grand Touring models or top-trim Signature models-an unusually high number.\r\nThe Signature trim level has been well received, selling more than twice as well as expected, and attracting customers who are trading up from traditional luxury brands.\r\nIt was natural, then, that Mazda would follow this plan with its flagship sedan. Mazda6 has received improvements every year it has been on sale. Updates for the previous model year added more sound insulation throughout its cabin and available Nappa leather interior appointments. Mazda6 also received standard G-Vectoring Control, a Mazda-exclusive technology that makes steering response more direct and linear by using a minute reduction of engine torque at turn-in to put extra weight on the front tires.',

Coinciding with Fiat 500\'s birthday, the iconic \"Spiaggina\" makes an elegant return to Europe\'s most famous resorts. Its new lease of life comes courtesy of the Fiat brand, which presents the new 500 Spiaggina \'58 special series, produced in a limited edition of 1,958 cars - a tribute to the year of the birth of the first \"Spiaggina\", with ultra-chic design touches and a lavish standard outfit. This is the first of Fiat\'s two tributes to celebrate both the legendary little car\'s birthday and the 60th anniversary of its first special series - the unforgettable 500 spiaggina dating from 1958, which became a universally acclaimed symbol of the \"Dolce Vita\". By marking these two important dates, Fiat also celebrates the secret of the 500\'s eternal youth: its capability to renew itself continually, also through special series, without ever losing its identity. And the Fiat brand has produced a second \"present\" for these special milestones: a delightful video to the notes of the song \"Volare\", the ever-popular Italian classic which also appeared in 1958.

So far prototypes were discreetly masked in black and white during the last test and test drives, so that nobody recognizes the details. A so-called \"covered drive\". The T-Cross will be different. The small SUV is intended to appeal to young customers and win for the brand - and this is already evident in the test drives. \"Black Uni\", \"Energetic Orange\" and \"Makena Turquoise\" are the names of the vehicle colors. The matching colored camouflage make the Covered Drive a Colored Drive. The T-Cross is meant to attract attention “It was very important to us to create a car that stands out in traffic,” says Klaus Bischoff, chief designer of the Volkswagen brand. “When you design an SUV, you have to make it look as if it could conquer any road on the planet. Independent, masculine, powerful. And these are all attributes the T-Cross has.” Outside of Munich, the T-Cross demonstrates its ability to conquer any road, when it reveals itself to a small group of people for the first time. Through gravel pits and the foothills of the Alps, along gravel roads and across fields toward Lake Starnberg. The T-Cross lets off steam, and that’s exactly what the smallest member of Volkswagen’s SUV family is for: small and big adventures in the cities and their outskirts.',
