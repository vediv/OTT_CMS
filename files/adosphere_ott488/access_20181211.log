Flush door handles add to the smooth, sculpted aesthetic, while sweeping directional indicators create a purposeful signature. Optional R-Dynamic details and burnished copper accents add to the unique appeal.\r\n\r\nInside, the finely crafted design integrates uncluttered surfaces and simple lines with carefully curated premium materials to create a luxurious, minimalist, digital cabin.

Now, Honda\'s highly anticipated Talon models marry the two worlds, bringing a new level of off-road excitement, precision, performance and quality to sport side-by-side driving. Drawing on countless hours of collaborative development in both two- and four-wheel design and racing, as well as automotive and motorcycle manufacturing knowhow and safety expertise, the Talons push the envelope of what is possible in a production sport side-by-side.\r\n\r\nAware that a single offering would be a compromise for some conditions and driving styles, Honda developed two versions of the Talon, each of which works across a broad array of conditions but specializes in a different area of the off-road spectrum. The two vehicles share a common frame and engine but have wheelbases and suspension configurations that are designed to shine in different applications. Both models function at a high level in a wide variety of terrain types, bringing a new level of control, style and refinement to a sport side-by-side market that is hungry for innovation, reliability and an improved driving experience.',

The styling highlight of the new neckwarmer is a chrome centre vane that stretches the full width of the duct, echoing Bentley’s famous ‘bullseye’ vents. Combined with a heated steering wheel, seat heaters and new heated armrests, these sophisticated comfort features create a luxurious driving experience in all environments.\r\n\r\nThe all-new Continental GT Convertible heightens the sensory experience of open-air motoring with exhilarating performance.

Mit über 60 technischen Innovationen hat sich auch das Design des neuen Mercedes-Benz Actros verändert. Besonders auffällig ist der Wegfall der herkömmlichen Außenspiegel. Stattdessen präsentiert sich die neue Serienversion des Schwerlast-Trucks dank dynamisch designter MirrorCam mit noch homogeneren Proportionen.Zum progressiven Look tragen auch die typischen Frontscheinwerfer mit LED-Tagfahrlicht bei: Die neue, geschwungene Lichtsignatur am oberen Scheinwerferrand macht den Actros bei Nacht unverwechselbar. Bei Tag hilft das neue serienmäßige LED-Tagfahrlicht dabei, dass andere Verkehrsteilnehmer den neuen Actros bestmöglich wahrnehmen. Neben dem fortschrittlichen Exterieur bestimmt vor allem der moderne Truck-Innenraum das Design des neuen Actros.Die Entwicklung des Interieur-Designs erfolgte beim neuen Actros konsequent um den Fahrer herum – nach dem Prinzip „inside out“. Für den Gestaltungsprozess bestimmend war deshalb die „User Experience“ des Fahrers. Besonders ersichtlich wird dies beim Multimedia-Cockpit. Zwei freischwebende, extrem hochauflösende Displays repräsentieren das Cockpit und lassen sich über Touch-Control-Pads im neu gestalteten Lenkrad bedienen. Beim Sekundärdisplay ist zusätzlich noch die Direktsteuerung über den Touchscreen möglich. Dabei ist die Darstellung auf den Monitoren nicht nur funktional erlebbar, sondern unterstreicht auch die emotionale Inszenierung sowie die Verständlichkeit der Bedienstruktur und begeistert durch brilliante Grafiken in höchster Pixelperfektion.',

The brand-new next generation hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle took to the streets of London across 31 days culminating in a weekend where the public had the opportunity to get behind the wheel.\r\n\r\nWith a total of 350 miles driven overall, the car – which actually cleans the air as it drives - was driven along London’s dirtiest driving route throughout the month. The route was mapped in partnership with University College London who reviewed open source data from a King’s College London pollution study to look at Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) levels and Particulate Matter (PM) levels with particularly congested roads including Marylebone Road and Park Lane.

The turbos are the granddaddies of the Porsche 911 family, madly desired since their introduction in 1974. They came close on the heels of BMW’s 2002 Turbo, which was the first street-legal sports car with then-newfangled turbocharging technology. The 911 Turbos have been setting the pace ever since. The 911 T S Cabriolet is noticeably more comfortable to drive on a daily basis under disparate conditions than many of its high-priced competitors. That’s not solely thanks to its four drive modes or the optional lift package that allows for an additional 1.5 inches of clearance, although these do much to smooth what might otherwise be anxious nerves at driving such a high-performing car on a daily basis.',

In addition, they launched a Cabriolet version of the 911 as well as the Speedster and the Targa. Its path to becoming an icon was already clearly laid.',
