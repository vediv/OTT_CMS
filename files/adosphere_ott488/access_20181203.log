The first example of the breed was the BMW X5, making it the founding father of the BMW X model family and the market leader in the premium all-wheel drive segment - a status it maintains to this day.\r\n\r\nMore than 2.2 million examples of the BMW X5 have been sold across its three model generations. And the new car puts down another marker in terms of design and technology. The new BMW X5 will again be built at BMW Plant Spartanburg in the US state of South Carolina. This centre of expertise for BMW X models also handles production of the BMW X3, BMW X4, BMW X6 - and will soon add the BMW X7 to its roster as well. \r\n\r\nA wheelbase 42 mm longer than its predecessor\'s (now 2,975 millimetres), a 36 mm increase in vehicle length (to 4,922 millimetres), an extra 66 mm of width (now 2,004 millimetres) and a 19 mm increase in height (to 1,745 millimetres) give the new BMW X5 both an imposing appearance and generous levels of space for passengers and their luggage. The latest X5 retains the hallmark proportions of an SAV, but the pared-back design language - clean surfacing and precise lines accentuating the car\'s robustness, elegant poise and muscular authority - is new. A powerfully sculpted bonnet, a short front overhang, lightly hexagonal wheel arches and the dynamic sweep of the roofline provide further references to the sporty yet rugged character of the new X5.',

It has been shot by director Kevin Macdonald, whose credits include ‘The Last King of Scotland,’ the Whitney Houston biopic ‘Whitney’ and the Oscar-winning documentary ‘One Day in September’. This world-first collaboration between AI and a renowned craftsman aimed to test the boundaries of how humans and machines can work together in perfect harmony, exploring the importance of intuition in the relationship between the two to showcase the responsive features of the new Lexus ES executive sedan. The result is an engaging short drama: a minute-long film telling the story of a Lexus Takumi Master Craftsman who completes his painstaking work and releases the new Lexus ES into the world, only for it to be taken away and threatened with destruction. At the crucial moment, the car’s automatic emergency braking system cuts in to save the day, demonstrating the value and effectiveness of the intuitive technology built into the car. ',
