In November 2017 the 600PS 5.0-litre supercharged V8 sedan beat some of the world’s fastest two-door coupes and supercars to set a record lap time of 7min 21.23sec.\r\n\r\nThrill-seekers will get a full demonstration of Project 8’s exceptional performance and handling as Jaguar’s professional drivers take them on a lap of ‘The Green Hell’ at speeds in excess of 250km/h (155mph). Passengers will also experience g-forces of more than 1.3g around the 20.8km (12.9-mile), 73-turn circuit – up to 1.8g in the banked Karussell corner.',

The technology pioneer is now taking the logical next step: putting its electric truck, the eActros, out on the road with customers. Ten vehicles in two variants, with a gross vehicle weight of 18 or 25 tonnes, will be handed over in the next few weeks to customers, who will be testing their everyday feasibility and economic efficiency under real-life conditions. The long-term aim: locally emission-free and quiet driving in urban environments with series-production trucks. The basis for the eActros is provided by the frame of the Actros. Otherwise, however, the vehicle architecture has been configured specifically for an electric drive system, with a high proportion of specific components. The drive axle, for example, is based on the ZF AVE 130 that has already proved its worth as a low-floor portal axle in hybrid and fuel-cell buses from Mercedes-Benz and is now being fundamentally revised for the eActros. The axle housing has been completely redesigned and is mounted in a significantly higher position, thereby increasing the ground clearance to more than 200 mm. The drive system comprises two electric motors located close to the rear-axle wheel hubs. They generate an output of 125 kW each, with maximum torque of 485 Nm each. The gearing ratios convert this into 11,000 Nm each, resulting in driving performance on a par with that of a diesel truck.\r\n',
