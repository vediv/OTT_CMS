For over 25 years, Maranello has been organising the most prestigious of all one-make championships, the Ferrari Challenge, in which over 100 drivers split into three continental series do battle at the wheel. Last year saw the introduction of the 488 Challenge, the first model in the series to be equipped with a turbo engine. The Ferrari 488 GTE is instead the car fielded in the FIA World Endurance Championship, the pinnacle of GT racing, where it has won two consecutive GT Manufacturers’ titles and no less than five titles in total since the championship’s inception in 2012. Thanks to wins in both the Pro and Am categories, the 488 GTE has taken no fewer than 35 out of the 50 races run to date. The new car’s engine adopts numerous solutions from that of the 488 Challenge and its power output has been increased to 720 cv. It is also lighter, thanks to new titanium con-rods and carbon-fibre intake plenums. The inverted radiator cooling system is also derived from the Challenge with the radiators raked rearwards (rather forwards as in the 488 GTB), improving cooling and maintaining optimal performance levels even in high thermal stress situations.',

The Opel Grandland X made its world premiere at the 2017 IAA (International Motor Show) in Frankfurt.\r\n\r\nIdeally equipped and well positioned, the new Grandland X comes to market in the fall as the third member of the Opel X family. It joins its Opel Crossland X and bestseller Opel Mokka X siblings, which both are some 20 centimeters shorter in length.

Its form and function have evolved over history, going from a simple ring we had to turn while wearing gloves for better grip and to prevent blisters, to being a major ally that now parks for us and enables us to control driving speed, music selection or the telephone without ever taking our eyes off the road. We go over how steering wheels have changed over 70 years of history by looking at SEAT models:\r\nThe 50s:\r\nThe steering wheel was a large, rigid ring made of synthetic resin that made driving a strength training exercise. Luxury models like the SEAT 1400 feature steering wheel mounted details such as the main beam flash switch. Even the gear lever was located on the steering column.\r\nThe 60s:\r\nThe models purchased by the middle class, such as the SEAT 600, featured a steering Wheel that was reduced to its bare bones. It was an element used only to turn the wheels, only featured a horn to alert other drivers and pedestrians of our presence, as vehicles were still an uncommon sight.\r\nThe 70s:\r\nThe SEAT 850 Spider was launched in the 70s, and sporty steering wheels became a glamorous statement piece. In those years they were beginning to use metal on the spokes and the classic round holes were added. Its wood trim gave it a touch of luxury.\r\nThe 70s:\r\nModels such as the SEAT 124 became a success in the late 70s. The horn was no longer in the middle, but at the side next to the two horizontal spokes, and was activated with the thumb.\r\nThe 80s and 90s:\r\nWith the arrival of power steering, the diameter of the steering wheel got smaller. On the early versions of the SEAT Ibiza, this part is made of a material similar to rubber, making it more ergonomic. The following generation in the 90s was then equipped with an airbag, and on the third one, the driver could select radio channels and control the volume from the steering wheel.\r\nToday:\r\nParking and lane control assistants and all information at hand. These are some of the features available now to drivers. Models such as the SEAT Ateca, enable us to control the interior temperature, select music, choose a route, select the driving speed or range and even make a telephone call from the steering wheel.',

Mazda6 carries a similar theme, called \"Mature Elegance,\" creating an added level of sophistication to Mazda\'s KODO-Soul of Motion design language that complements its aspirational ambitions.\r\n\r\nUp front is Mazda6\'s new grille, which accentuates a look of depth, with a strong framework, low center of gravity and wide stance. Its standard LED headlights integrate fog lamps and carry a crisp, wide lighting signature. Painted surfaces extend lower on the body, and new 17- and 19-inch wheel designs complement the upgraded appearance. Finally, Soul Red Crystal paint makes its debut on Mazda\'s sedan, joining Machine Gray Metallic and a full palette of available paint colors.\r\n\r\nInside, the interior is all-new, with only the steering wheel and small trim pieces carried over from its predecessor. Most noticeable is its horizontally stretched dashboard that accentuates Mazda6\'s width and belies a sense of subtle sophistication. On Mazda6 Signature models, Sen wood, Nappa leather and UltraSuede® NU adorn the doors, seats and dashboard, providing an atmosphere that can coddle on Rodeo Drive just as easily as it can enliven spirited drives on Mulholland.',

This is the new Opel Grandland X - with a host of top technologies on board and plenty of space for up to five adventurous passengers, their luggage and sport equipment. These qualities make the Opel a new contender in the booming SUV segment. In the compact class alone, the SUV share has increased from seven percent in 2010 to nearly 20 percent today. The 4.48 meter-long Grandland X\'s athletic look boasts crisp exterior dimensions with its taut muscles and short overhangs. And with optional two-color finish, the compact SUV shows its very own style. The Opel Grandland X made its world premiere at the 2017 IAA (International Motor Show) in Frankfurt.\r\n\r\nIdeally equipped and well positioned, the new Grandland X comes to market in the fall as the third member of the Opel X family. It joins its Opel Crossland X and bestseller Opel Mokka X siblings, which both are some 20 centimeters shorter in length. At the same time, the Grandland X expands the extensive Opel portfolio in the very popular compact car segment from Astra to Zafira.',
