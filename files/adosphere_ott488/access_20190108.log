The most obvious identifying feature of the new BMW 2-Series Active Tourer and BMW 2-Series Gran Tourer at first glance is their significantly larger kidney grille, which is both taller and wider, and now stretches almost all the way to the headlight units. As a result, it exudes notably more presence and expressiveness. The front apron is dominated by the large air intake, which is split into three sections and bordered by large, C-shaped surrounds in a highgloss black finish. The outer air intakes, meanwhile, house the new optional LED foglamps, further accentuating the cutting-edge, sporty feel.',

It offered generous amounts of space within a compact exterior, together with excellent versatility and high levels of driver engagement. The first ever Sports Activity Tourer (SAT) from BMW quickly gained in popularity and turned into one of the brand\'s highest sellers. It was followed a year later by a second model version in the form of the BMW 2-Series Gran Tourer, complete with a longer body, extended wheelbase and up to seven seats. By the end of 2017, these two models based on BMW\'s compact front-wheel-drive architecture had amassed in excess of 380,000 buyers, with almost 70 per cent opting for the Active Tourer. With conquest rates as high as 80 per cent, the majority of customers are new to the brand. The most important market is Germany, which absorbs about 25 per cent of total production. China is next up, followed by the UK. This success story is set to continue with the arrival of the updated models in March 2018.

It is found around the standard leather multifunction sports steering wheel, the gear shift lever trim, the floor mats and the outer seat surfaces. The sport seats, which are suitable for practically any driver stature, feature the legendary \'Clark\' plaid pattern on their inner surfaces (red, dark grey and light grey stripes and black squares). Black leather upholstery is available as an option. Numerous chrome details also upgrade the interior (including the steering wheel, gear knob, instrument surrounds, air vent tabs, climate controls, pedals and many buttons). Also exclusively coordinated for the GTI are the decorative trim elements of the dash panel, centre console and door trims. The dash panel can be ordered in Deep Iron Gloss or Velvet Red; the instruments in the upper dash area are always finished in black.',
