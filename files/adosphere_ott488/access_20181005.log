It once again elevated Mazda, showing if Mazda built an SUV with superior driving dynamics, class-above refinement, an abundance of amenities, technology and a strong engine, customers would come. After more than a year since going on sale, approximately 55 percent of all Mazda CX-9 crossover SUVs sold in the U.S. have been either high-level Grand Touring models or top-trim Signature models-an unusually high number.\r\nThe Signature trim level has been well received, selling more than twice as well as expected, and attracting customers who are trading up from traditional luxury brands.\r\nIt was natural, then, that Mazda would follow this plan with its flagship sedan. Mazda6 has received improvements every year it has been on sale. Updates for the previous model year added more sound insulation throughout its cabin and available Nappa leather interior appointments. Mazda6 also received standard G-Vectoring Control, a Mazda-exclusive technology that makes steering response more direct and linear by using a minute reduction of engine torque at turn-in to put extra weight on the front tires.',
