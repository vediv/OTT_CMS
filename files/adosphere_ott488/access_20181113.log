The world’s most popular classic car exhibition is providing the meeting point for the international classic scene for the 30th time. From 21 to 25 March 2018, it offers the ideal frame to celebrate the landmark birthdays of some outstandingly fascinating models. At Essen, BMW Group Classic is looking back on the debut of the BMW M1 40 years ago. The mid-engined sports car with its timeless design and motor-sport history is one of the milestones in the company’s heritage. Ten years previously, the BMW 2800 CS had already ushered in the era of “large coupés”. These models were similarly the defining representative of their era both on the road and on the race track. BMW M1: Italian styling, Bavarian engine-building artistry. The common feature of the BMW M1 and the brand’s large coupés is their characteristic harmony combining aesthetics and sportiness. The body styling masterminded by Italian designer Giorgio Giugiaro gave the BMW M1 – only 1.14 metres in height – an Italian profile. The car’s inline six-cylinder engine was by contrast a masterpiece from Munich. Just like the vehicle concept, the drive technology was conceived to master the challenges on the race track and meet the requirements for being licensed as a road-going vehicle.',

The new BMW 8 Series Convertible blends ultra-sporty driving properties with distinctive design elegance and an extremely exclusive taste of driving pleasure in an open-top four-seater. The newly developed soft-top roof enhances the two-door car’s low, sporting lines when closed – and its sweeping elegance once open. The powertrain and chassis technology developed for the BMW 8 Series was tuned on the race track as well as the road. It serves up impressive performance attributes and peerless levels of poise and assurance, all of which are experienced with even greater intensity when the sun and wind are invited in. Model-specific equipment features designed to enhance comfort and state-of-the-art innovations when it comes to control & operation, driver assistance and connectivity serve up an open-top experience as modern as it is luxurious. The new BMW 8 Series Convertible has been created to provide sporty performance and a luxurious open-top driving experience. One of the factors contributing to the driving enjoyment offered by this new convertible for the luxury segment is the design of the high-quality interior, with its precisely crafted details. The cohesive harmony between the exterior and interior is revealed particularly effectively when the soft-top is down. The occupants of the four seats are surrounded by the sweeping flow of the instrument panel, the door shoulders, the shoulder area around the rear seats and the soft-top compartment cover. Flush joints between the side channel seals and the surround of the soft-top compartment underline the harmonious transition from front to rear.',

The challenges included driving through a water slalom obstacle, a precision driving test and a ‘smart cone’ course. With the two quickest teams qualifying for the gold medal showdown, it was France who came out on top, finishing faster than silver medallists Australia, who were represented by Craig McGrath and Scott Reynolds. After finishing with the third quickest time in the heats, the United Kingdom team of Mark Perkins and Daniel Bingley took bronze. Prof. Dr Ralf Speth, Jaguar Land Rover CEO, said: “Having been Presenting Partner of the Invictus Games since they were founded in 2014, everyone at Jaguar Land Rover is hugely passionate about this event.
