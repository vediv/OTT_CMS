More than just an engineering achievement, the GA-K platform gave the designers the flexibility to create an ES that\'s as visibly striking as it is enjoyable to drive. The result is an ES sedan that is longer (+2.6 in / 65 mm), lower (-0.2 in / 5 mm) and wider (+1.8 in / 45 mm) than before with wheels that have been pushed closer to the corners thanks to a two-inch longer wheelbase and wider tracks front (+0.4 in / 10 mm) and rear (+1.5 in / 37 mm).

To facilitate this, the students invited SKODA customers and fans to submit suggestions via different social media channels. In the end, Sunroq was chosen from among several hundred proposed names – the students found that it suited their cabriolet perfectly given its openness to the sun, which makes it an ideal vehicle for a summer holiday.

While the under-lamp ornamentation -available in Black, Glossy Black or Silver- accentuates the \'X\' signature and the vehicle\'s width.\r\n\r\nIn profile, the more three-dimensional frontal form combines with newly designed outer lenses in the rear lamp clusters to strengthen the visual connection between the front and rear, giving the impression of forward movement and increased dynamism.\r\n\r\nAt the rear, the new LED light guides give the Toyota AYGO a sophisticated look and make the model instantly recognisable. The unique light signature creates the perception of a compact cabin above a wider lower bumper area, to emphasise the vehicle\'s rear width and stability.\r\n\r\nThe new exterior styling is completed with a choice of eight body colours, two of which are new -Rich Blue Metallic and, exclusive to the x-cite grade, Magenta Splash Metallic. The addition of new 15\" technical-look wheel caps and 15\" alloys -with a design unique to each grade- further strengthens the premium looks of the new AYGO.',

Its instantly recognisable, trademark \'X\' frontal design and the broad range of customisation options it offered ensured that it always stood out from the crowd.\r\n\r\nAppealing to a more style-conscious audience than those who buy their cars for purely rational reasons, the AYGO\'s striking good looks and engaging driving characteristics made it one of the best-performing Toyota models for attracting new buyers and conquest sales.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Toyota AYGO was amongst the top sellers of the A-segment with more than 85,000 units sold, and a segment share of 6.6%.\r\n\r\nThe new AYGO further strengthens the model\'s unique DNA and stand-out positioning within the highly-competitive A-segment.

Escalade quickly grew to dominate its segment, leading in total sales since 2014 and for 15 of the last 20 years. In fact, each year since the Escalade was redesigned in 2015, consumers have spent about $3 billion or more on the model. Sales have topped more than three-quarters of a million in the U.S. and 836,000 cumulative global sales (including ESV, EXT and Hybrid models). Success Story Born in the nascent days of the luxury SUV movement, the Escalade quickly established itself as the segment’s preeminent entry, channeling Cadillac’s signature design, technology and performance in an all-new proportion. Customer response was quick and intense, as buyers embraced the Escalade’s spaciousness, capability and unmistakable presence. The Escalade’s strong initial sales leaped more than 35 percent when the second-generation model was launched for 2002 and grew another 55 percent the following year, when the versatile Escalade EXT model entered full production. By its fifth anniversary in 2004, Escalade sales had ballooned approximately 230 percent, and the vehicle had changed the lexicon of luxury vehicles for customers, trendsetting influencers and valets.',

That podium that today has become a catwalk able to offer a unique view, both to those above and to the public below.\r\n\r\nThe national Grand Prix number 69 (only one, remember, was not held in Monza but in Imola in the 80) started practically close to that of Belgium. A small team was seconded for the preparation of the Milan event on Wednesday 29, the activity at the Autodromo began in the early days of the week. Spa and Monza chase each other on the calendar and, in the collective imagination, they also look like super-fast tracks. In reality there are several differences, because the route of Brianza does not have the full bends from that of the Ardennes but, on the contrary, asks a lot more to the brakes and promises, in a straight line, even greater speeds. If there is a common point, besides being two classics of the calendar, it is the passion of the fans that never fails. And that in Monza, not even to say it, is above all red passion.',

The limited special edition of the roadster inspires not only with the agility, precision and dynamic handling characteristics that are so typical of BMW M Performance models, but also with particularly sophisticated design and equipment features, including a body paintwork in Frozen Orange metallic.\r\n\r\nThe new edition of the roadster celebrated its world premiere at precisely the same location that served as the stage for the first public presentation of the BMW Concept Z4 in 2017. With its puristic, dynamic and progressive design language, the concept vehicle presented a vision of a charismatic sports car which, thanks to the production model, now becomes reality. Just a glance at the new BMW Z4\'s proportions leaves no doubt about its dynamic potential. The central sitting position for the driver, the low centre of gravity, perfectly balanced 50 : 50 axle load distribution, wide tracks and a compact wheelbase form the ideal prerequisites for inspiringly agile handling and intense driving pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe BMW Z4 M40i First Edition fulfils these expectations in every aspect thanks to an extremely powerful 250 kW/340 hp, straight six-cylinder engine and a sports suspension with electronically controlled dampers, M Sport braking system and an electronically controlled M Sport differential in the rear axle transmission.

Thanks to its optimal handling performance, the DIVO dances nimbly through curves; every bend becomes an exhilarating moment, a thrill that endures. The DIVO is a more extreme BUGATTI. It represents a new interpretation of our philosophy ‘form follows performance’ with an uncompromising pursuit of the utmost aerodynamic efficiency. To shape the future, we have embraced the past. The DIVO harks back to the golden era of coachbuilding, a proud tradition nearly a century old, by uniting a rolling chassis with a brand new body. The design is imposingly powerful and striking – unmistakably BUGATTI.',

The design of the interior also places the focus on the puristic sportiness of the new BMW Z4. The driver-oriented cockpit styling is underscored by dynamic forward-oriented lines. Likewise, the clearly structured arrangement of all control elements enhances the focus on the driving experience inside the new BMW Z4.\r\n\r\nMoreover, for a perfect start into a new roadster era, the new BMW Z4 M40i First Edition offers specific design and equipment features that add exclusive accents to the car\'s sporty flair. The expressive body paintwork in Frozen Orange metallic is combined with an electrically operated textile soft top in anthracite with silver effect, the BMW Individual High Gloss Shadow Line, black exterior mirror caps and 19-inch light alloy wheels boasting a bicolour, double spoke design. The interior of the edition model comprises the Vernasca black leather trim with decorative stitching, electrically adjustable seats with memory function, the option ambient light and the Harman Kardon Surround Sound System. Adaptive LED headlights with matrix function for the high beam, BMW Head-Up Display featured for the first time in a roadster and the BMW Live Cockpit Professional offering the latest networking technology underpin the advanced status the tradition-steeped concept of a two-seater, open-top sports car has reached with the new BMW Z4.',

At the exclusive automotive event “The Quail: A Motorsports Gathering“ in Monterey, California, Bugatti has presented its latest model as a world premiere. With the Divo, the French luxury brand has developed a super sports car tuned for agility, nimbleness and optimum handling performance on winding roads. It is powered by Bugatti’s iconic eight-litre W16 engine with a power output of 1,500 PS. The aerodynamics of the model have been intensively fine-tuned and the suspension and chassis settings have been modified. As a result, the Divo is 35 kilograms (77 lbs) lighter and has 90 kilograms (198 lbs) more downforce than the standard Chiron2. The lateral acceleration of the Divo has been boosted to 1.6 g. Its maximum speed is limited to 380 km/h (236 mph). The Divo can lap the Nardò handling circuit in southern Italy eight seconds faster than the Chiron. The series will only consist of 40 vehicles. Upon the start of presentations to selected customers, the strictly limited small series, with a net unit price of €5 million, sold out immediately.',

The streamlined silhouette of the approximately 5.3-metre long and approximately one metre shallow one-seater vehicle is slender yet sensuous.\r\n\r\nThe show car\'s body structure is made of carbon fibre. The multiple layers of paintwork in alubeam silver appear like liquid metal over the top. This concept represents the design polar opposites of \"hot\" and \"cold\". Functional attachment parts made of carbon fibre such as the front splitter epitomise the cool and rational aspect of this philosophy. The same applies to the front trim designed as a display, as well as the continuous lighting strip at the front. The side skirts also feature a lighting strip and the large, recessed EQ lettering in front of the rear wheels is illuminated blue as is characteristic of the brand.\r\n\r\nOther highlights include the driver\'s cockpit, which can be folded forwards, and the partially free-standing multi-spoke wheels. The non-rotating hub caps and the partial trim on the wheels are other stylish and innovative highlights. The 168 spokes per wheel are made of lightweight aluminium and are painted a rose gold colour as is typical for EQ.',
