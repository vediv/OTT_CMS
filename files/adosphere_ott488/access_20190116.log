They combine powerful performance with sporty style and high efficiency. At their heart lies a new, electrified 3.0-litre engine featuring twin-turbocharging by means of an exhaust gas turbocharger and an electric auxiliary compressor. The 6-cylinder in-line engine generates 320 kW (435 hp) and delivers maximum torque of 520 Nm. Its EQ Boost starter-alternator momentarily provides an additional 16 kW of output plus 250 Nm of torque and furthermore feeds the 48 V on-board electrical system. Other technical highlights include the AMG SPEEDSHIFT TCT 9G transmission and the fully variable all-wheel drive system AMG Performance 4MATIC+. Distinguishing features which are common to the three new 53-series models comprise the twin-blade radiator grille, the front apron in A-wing design, the AMG-specific side sill panels, the rear apron with diffuser insert plus the round exhaust tailpipe trim elements in high-gloss chrome.',

As the truck\'s backbone, the frame uses advanced materials and engineering to eliminate 100 pounds while increasing stiffness and durability for 12,750 pounds of towing capability and 2,300 pounds of payload.\r\n\r\nAn all-new eTorque system delivers improved fuel efficiency in both V-6 and V-8 configurations.\r\n\r\nAs a segment disrupter, the new Uconnect 4C with a massive 12-inch touchscreen leads the pickup world with technology featuring split-screen capability, 360-degree camera views and exclusive content from SiriusXM with 360L.\r\n\r\nActive safety and security systems join the technology onslaught with adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, Blind-spot Monitoring and ready alert braking.\r\n\r\nThe new Ram 1500 uses the longest, lightest and most efficient frame in the half-ton truck segment. The chassis has reduced weight by 120 pounds - 100 pounds from the frame alone delivering a maximum payload of 2,300 pounds and maximum trailer tow capacity of 12,750 pounds. The strongest Ram 1500 frame ever produced includes the same impact countermeasures across all configurations, and is made from 98 percent high-strength steel. Exclusive front splayed frame rail technology (patent pending) creates a highly efficient energy absorbing structure for all impact modes, including front-offset with frame integration forward of front tire. Also, frame-mounted high-strength steel tire blockers are placed behind the front tires to force wheels outward in the event of impact. Additionally, side rails are taller and fully boxed. To further improve NVH, new electronically controlled side-frame-mounted active tuned-mass modules (ATMM) work in harmony with an interior active noise cancellation (ANC) system on 5.7-liter HEMI V-8 equipped models to reduce ambient sounds down to a low 67.1 db - the quietest Ram 1500 ever. Rear cross members are double sheer welded to the inside and outside of the frame for improved durability and roll stiffness.',

Comprehensive revisions to the 120 PS 1.6 i-DTEC diesel engine for the all-new Honda Civic range endow it with an outstanding combination of performance and efficiency. The improvements reduce cylinder friction, improve the efficiency of NOx conversion, and further develop the driveability of the car. Under the combined cycle of the revised NEDC test, the new Civic 1.6 i-DTEC has achieved low CO2 emissions of 93g/km, with official average fuel economy of 3.5 l/100km (80.7 mpg) recorded for all grades. The other new model tested is the 2018 Honda Jazz, which has a fresh look and the addition of a 130 PS 1.5 i-VTEC petrol engine – introduced in response to customer demand for a more powerful variant. The new petrol engine combines high output with low fuel consumption, and complies with stringent Euro 6 emissions standards. It achieves fuel economy of 5.4 l/100km (52.3 mpg) and CO2 emissions from 124g/km with the optional CVT automatic transmission. The CVT system itself has been revised to deliver a more linear and refined response under acceleration.',

It is a concentrate of Ducati technology, style and performance. A motorcycle that, with a displacement of 1,103 cm3, 214 HP of power and a power / weight ratio of 1,1 CV / kg, becomes the new reference in the segment of supersports of production. The Panigale V4 replaces the iconic 1299 Panigale and increases its performance and ease of driving, to offer every driver, from the less expert to the top rider, great emotions and fun. Developed in close collaboration with Ducati Corse, it exploits the know-how and technology of the racing world to be the closest road bike to a MotoGP. Its performance is underlined by a design that, although in continuity with that of the super sports cars that preceded it, transmits even more markedly the sense of power and essentiality typical of Ducati racing motorcycles. The designation Panigale V4 combines the name \"Panigale\", and the charm that evokes to the fans, with the initials \"V4\", identifying the engine that opens the new era of the Italian motorcycle manufacturer.',

The cabin espouses a hand-crafted feel, achieved by combining two Japanese approaches to the treatment of materials: Mitate and Shitate. Mitate (pronounced \"me-ta-teh\") relates to the practice of curating and bringing together the finest selection of materials. Shitate (\"she-ta-teh\") is the desire to tailor the chosen combination of materials to bring out their best characteristics. This fine attention to detail in handling materials creates an appearance and ambience greater than the mere sum of their parts. Specialty trim and color combinations allow for personal expression inside the 2019 QX50. Interior package options give customers a choice of trim colors and materials. Colors include Black, Dark Blue, Mid Brown and White, with each used across a variety of surfaces, from the center console leather to other parts of the trim. Smooth leather or quilting is used for seats, with open-pore wood or aluminum adorning the dashboard, while the customer\'s preferred color options are evident throughout the cabin. Using bespoke manufacturing methods, wrap-and-sew detailing is a highlight of the hand-crafted ambience. The leather on the dash is selected for its quality and is hand-wrapped over the edges of the panels. The seats, door panels and dashboard feature a laser hole-cut stitch pattern specifically tailored to follow the curves of the interior surfaces. Contrast color stitching is used on the seats, paired with 3mm piping for a luxury look and feel.',

The 6-cylinder in-line engine generates 320 kW (435 hp) and delivers maximum torque of 520 Nm. Its EQ Boost starter-alternator momentarily provides an additional 16 kW of output plus 250 Nm of torque and furthermore feeds the 48 V on-board electrical system. Other technical highlights include the AMG SPEEDSHIFT TCT 9G transmission and the fully variable all-wheel drive system AMG Performance 4MATIC+. Distinguishing features which are common to the three new 53-series models comprise the twin-blade radiator grille, the front apron in A-wing design, the AMG-specific side sill panels, the rear apron with diffuser insert plus the round exhaust tailpipe trim elements in high-gloss chrome.',

Launched in Lotus’ 70th year and ahead of its anniversary celebrations, the new Evora GT410 Sport takes one of Lotus’ success stories, and refines it through the application of enlightened design. Available in both 2 seat and 2+2 configurations, and in manual and automatic transmissions, the Evora GT410 Sport draws from the phenomenal Evora GT430 to provide advanced aerodynamics to an already celebrated sports car.Combining the latest design philosophy with a car acclaimed by both critics and customers, it packs raw performance with Lotus’ latest aerodynamic developments, to provide a first-class replacement for the Evora Sport 410 model. Employing key elements of the GT430’s sculptured body style, including specifically designed new composite front and rear body panels, but without some of the high downforce elements, the new Evora GT410 Sport enjoys a far subtler and sleeker silhouette. However, as with all Lotus sports cars, aerodynamic downforce is a requirement and this new GT-class coupe generates up to 96kg of downforce (50% more than the Evora Sport 410) making it the new benchmark when compared to similarly priced rivals.',
