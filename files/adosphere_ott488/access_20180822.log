Located a few miles from the Adriatic Sea on the road named for Daijiro Kato, the track is celebrating its 46th anniversary this year.\r\n\r\nOver the course of the years, the track has undergone numerous changes until it completed its current 2,625-mile configuration in 2008.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the 16 corners, there are only eight braking sections because several changes in direction are made without using the brakes.\r\n\r\nThe Italian track is one of the few in the Championship that doesn\'t reach decelerations of 1.4 G and 1.5 G. So, the risk of overheating the systems is low.\r\n\r\nAccording to Brembo technicians, who work closely with 16 World Superbike riders, the Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli presents a medium level of difficulty on the brakes.\r\n\r\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, it earned a 3 on the difficulty index, the same score given to the Laguna Seca and Portimão tracks.
