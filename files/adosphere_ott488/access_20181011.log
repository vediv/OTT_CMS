A powerful three-litre V6 engine (250 kW/340 hp) combines with a virtually silent electric engine (100 kW/136 hp) to generate system power of 340 kW (462 hp). The maximum torque of 700 Nm is already available just above the idling speed. The boost strategy matches that of the 918 Spyder supercar, just like in the new hybrid Panamera models. The Cayenne\'s plug-in hybrid drive enables acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h in 5.0 seconds and a maximum speed of 253 km/h. The new Cayenne E-Hybrid can drive up to a distance of 44 kilometres and speed of 135 km/h on electricity alone, producing no local emissions. The average consumption of the all-wheeler in the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC), depending on the set of tyres used, is 3.4 - 3.2 l/100 km fuel and 20.9 - 20.6 kWh/100 km of electricity.',
