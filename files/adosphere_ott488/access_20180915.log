The special edition is a road version, derived for the series, of the racing car of the same name and two-time overall winner of the international TCR race series. The successful touring racing car\'s specs make the new top model a dominating presence: design, power and performance are intrinsic to the pure sports car doctrine. The 2.0 litre turbo engine of the new Volkswagen Golf GTI TCR delivers 213 kW / 290 PS (at 5,000 to 6,800 rpm). The maximum torque of 370 Nm lies between 1,600 and 4,300 rpm. Power is transmitted to the front wheels as standard via a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox (DSG) and a locking differential. The factory-set maximum speed is 250 km/h, but this can be increased to 264 km/h as mentioned above by opting to remove the electronic Vmax limiter. Wherever the digital speedometer needle (standard Active Info Display) stops, the newly developed roof edge spoiler ensures the necessary downforce at the rear axle. The new Golf GTI TCR is expected to be launched at the end of 2018. Numerous individual features add to the Volkswagen Golf GTI TCR\'s sporty character and robust look. The new top Golf GTI model has 18-inch \"Belvedere\" forged wheels from the Wolfsburg plant as standard. the newly designed 19-inch alloy wheels are optionally available. Lurking behind the large alloy wheels are perforated brake discs together with special brake calipers and pads to slow racing fans down just as confidently as the role model on the racetrack.',
