A powerful three-litre V6 engine (250 kW/340 hp) combines with a virtually silent electric engine (100 kW/136 hp) to generate system power of 340 kW (462 hp).

The G63 underpins its unique position among performance off-road vehicles with the powerful drive system, the newly developed AMG RIDE CONTROL suspension, the AMG-specific transmission modes and the new interior with optimal widescreen cockpit. The basis for the hallmark AMG Driving Performance both on and off metalled roads is provided by the 430 kW (585 hp) 4.0-litre V8 biturbo engine, the rear-biased all-wheel drive (40:60) with three differential locks, the extremely fast-shifting 9-speed automatic transmission, the double wishbone independent front suspension and the adaptive adjustable damping. The reinterpretation of the unmistakable design creates strong highlights with the AMG-specific radiator grille, flared wheel arches, striking side pipes on the exhaust system and the up to 22-inch wheels.',

Each part and every bolt came under close scrutiny\", explains Dr Gunnar Güthenke, Head of the Off-Road Product Group at Mercedes-Benz. \"With the body, our main focus was on increasing the vehicle rigidity and the connections between the suspension and drivetrain with the ladder-type frame\".\r\n\r\nAt the time of market launch in June 2018, the Mercedes-Benz G-Class will be available at an entry-level price of €107,040.50 (price in Germany, incl.
