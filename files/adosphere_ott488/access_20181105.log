With a powerful performance from the four-litre V8 biturbo engine (338 kW/460 hp), dynamic chassis systems including adaptive air suspension, and their own unique design elements and equipment, the Porsche Panamera GTS and Panamera GTS Sport Turismo harness a one-of-a-kind performance package. As you would expect from a factory GTS, the basic equipment package is extensive. For example, the Sport Design package with black exterior elements and large Alcantara surfaces in the interior is included as standard. What\'s more, Porsche has expanded its portfolio of comfort and assis-tance systems to include a head-up display with various configuration options for the entire Panamera range.At the heart of both of the new Porsche Panamera GTS models is a four-litre V8 engine with 338 kW (460 hp) of output and maximum torque of 620 Nm, cultivating an emotional sound and driving experience when combined with the standard sports exhaust sys-tem. The biturbo engine, which features a gasoline particulate filter, outperforms its predecessor by 15 kW (20 hp) and 100 Nm, accelerating the Porsche Panamera GTS and Panamera GTS Sport Turismo from 0 to 100 km/h in 4.1 seconds as it works in con-junction with the standard Sport Chrono Package. The two models achieve a top speed of 292 and 289 km/h, respectively. There are no interruptions in tractive force as power is transmitted to the Porsche Traction Management (PTM) four-wheel drive system by the eight-speed PDK dual clutch gearbox.
