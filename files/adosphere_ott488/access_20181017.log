Whether motorways, Alpine passes, narrow alleyways through remote villages or simply seeing and being seen in front of the café on the market square – the BMW Motorrad Concept 9cento is the perfect choice for a spontaneous trip to Lake Como – as well as for the surrounding landscape and far beyond. With its compact silhouette, the BMW Motorrad Concept 9cento conveys agility and lightness at first sight – its proportions simply make you want to get on and ride off. The basic sporty configuration with lots of volume near the front wheel and a short high rear promises riding fun and agile handling. The striking styling of the fairing, fuel tank and frame further highlights the focus on the direction of travel. Here, the three-dimensional modelling of the fuel tank area especially comes into its own as a result of the paint finish with reflective chrome effect. The hovering side panel in Pure Metal Silver is typical of the Adventure Sport segment and is highly recognisable. On all aluminium parts such as the central tank cover, the rear carrier and the footrest holder, the milling is directed towards the front wheel. This finely grooved surface structure is only apparent on close inspection and has the effect of a topographical elevation relief.',

The exterior design of the Golf, which has been systematically developed over a period of more than 40 years, has been consciously advanced to a new evolutionary level. That is because the success of the Golf - along with its technical concept and all-round qualities - has always been based on a design that is considered unmistakable and extends beyond class boundaries. This has made the Golf one of the world\'s few compact vehicles that does not necessarily reflect the financial resources of its owner.

They are aimed particularly at drivers who love design and appreciate a vehicle that is ideally suited for everyday use but do not want to sacrifice sportiness. In addition to a number of performance-orientated features, the GTS models boast a high trim level, even in the basic package. Sporty contrasts and exceptional details give them that added extra.\r\n\r\nThe 904 Carrera GTS first brought motorsport technology to the streets as a road-approved sports car back in 1963. The 924 GTS and 928 GTS that followed refined this principle throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 2010, the GTS celebrated its rebirth in the form of the 911 Carrera GTS (Type 997), followed in 2014 by the Porsche Boxster GTS and Cayman GTS.\r\n\r\nThe beating heart of every Porsche sports car has always been the flat engine. The mid-engine 718 GTS is powered by a 2.5-litre, four-cylinder turbo flat engine with 269 kW (365 hp). The maximum torque of 430 Nm in conjunction with PDK is achieved between 1,900 and 5,000 rpm. As a result, it is available much earlier than in the previous GTS with a six-cylinder flat engine. In combination with the six-speed manual transmission, a maximum torque of 420 Nm is available between 1,900 and 5,500 rpm. With these improvements, the turbo engine delivers 11 kW (15 hp) more power than the 718 S models and up to 26 kW (35 hp) more power than its GTS predecessor with naturally aspirated engine.',

The diamond grille with chrome pins, brilliant black optics and AMG lettering are other features of the AMG 43 models.\r\nThe side view is dominated by AMG light alloy five-spoke 19-inch high gloss wheels painted in glossy black. The rear end also features distinctive highlights, with two four-flow chrome exhaust outlets that convey a particularly sporty aesthetic. The rear apron trim in diffuser look is silver chrome, while the standard spoiler lip on the trunk lid is painted in the body color.\r\nThe interior reinforces the dynamic caliber of the new E 43 4MATIC with many individual details. The driver and front passenger find a secure position in sports seats even in fast driving, thanks to improved side support. The artificial leather upholstery ARTICO / microfiber DINAMICA in black (optional: Nappa leather) has a particular layout and red stitching. To match the seat design, the center door panels and dashboard are finished in ARTICO artificial leather with red stitching. Exclusive pedals, a black roof lining and red safety belts add other sporting highlights.\r\nThe multifunction sport steering wheel in black nappa leather with contrasting red stitching and the flattened lower part is perfect for an emphatic style of driving.

That makes it the most powerful five-cylinder engine on the world market. Its 480 Nm (354.0 lb-ft) of torque is available at engine speeds between 1,700 and 5,850 revolutions per minute for outstanding tractive power. The compact RS model sprints from 0 to 100 km/h (62.1 mph) in just 4.1 seconds. It can attain a maximum speed of 250 km/h (155.3 mph); on request Audi will increase the electronically limited top speed to 280 km/h (174.0 mph). The unique sound of the five-cylinder unit intensifies an already emotionally charged driving experience. Its sound comes from having the ignition alternate between directly adjacent cylinders and widely spaced ones. The sound can be modified via Audi drive select.\r\n\r\nWith its light-alloy crankcase, the five-cylinder engine is 26 kilograms (57.3 lb) lighter than its predecessor. It employs a dual injection into the intake manifold and into the combustion chambers, as well as the Audi valvelift system for variable control of the exhaust valves.

The all-digital MMI touch response system provides intuitive operation and even more personalization. The extensive connectivity and assistance systems demonstrate intelligent automotive connectivity. The suspension combines smooth ride comfort and unshakable stability with enhanced sportiness. All engines use an efficient mild hybrid system.\r\n\r\nTo further enhance comfort and efficiency, all available engines in the new A6 are fitted with a mild hybrid system. This signifies that, after the A8 and the A7, Audi has now fully electrified a third model line. A belt alternator starter (BAS) works together with a lithium-ion battery with 10 Ah capacity. In combination with the six-cylinder engines, a 48V mild hybrid system is used. The A6 can coast between 55 and 160 km/h (34.2 and 99.4 mph) and the start-stop kicks in right from 22 km/h (13.7 mph). During deceleration, the BAS recovers up to 12 kW of energy. In real-world driving, the mild hybrid technology based on 48V reduces fuel consumption by up to 0.7 liters per 100 kilometers.\r\n\r\nLong journeys are the domain of the new Audi A6. With a generous amount of space, many convenience features and minimal interior noise, the business-class sedan pampers driver and passengers alike. Its interior is even larger than on the outgoing model – the A6 beats the core competitors in important criteria such as legroom in the rear.\r\n\r\nThe A6 is perfectly equipped for long journeys with new convenience functions. The seats are all-new. The top-of-the-line options include the customized contour front seats with numerous adjustment functions, optionally fitted with ventilation and massage function. The optional air quality package provides a subtle fragrance and improves the air with an ionizer. The optional panoramic glass sunroof floods the interior with light. The luggage compartment, with its capacity of 530 liters will accommodate two golf bags crosswise, while the trunk lid can be closed electrically with a kicking motion as an option.\r\n\r\nOn the sleek instrument panel of the new A6, a technical, futuristic black-panel design dominates which impressively combines form and function. The design language appears reduced and matter-of-fact; the horizontal lines create an airy sense of space. The center console and the two MMI touch response displays are angled slightly toward the driver. When switched off, the top display is incorporated almost invisibly into the dark decorative surface.\r\n\r\nThe wide range of colors and materials which Audi provides for the new A6 lend the interior design very different characteristics – from elegant through contemporary to sporty. Five interior trim lines are available with different color concepts: basic, sport, design, design selection and the S line sport package with 19-inch wheels and sport suspension. All elements, from the open-pore wood trim to the upholstery in Valcona leather, attest to the uncompromisingly high Audi quality. The S line exterior package is available as an option for all trim lines.\r\n',

The engine found in the Skoda Kodiaq RS produces 176 kW (240 PS), making it the most powerful production diesel in the history of Skoda. It offers a particularly emotive engine note thanks to Dynamic Sound Boost - which is making its debut in a Skoda. This perfectly complements the power of the Skoda Kodiaq RS, which holds the lap record for seven-seater SUVs on the Nürburgring\'s Nordschleife with a time of 9 minutes, 29.84 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe initials RS now represent the perfect combination of a sporty driving experience and excellent suitability for daily use. The Skoda Kodiaq RS is now the brand\'s first ever SUV to bear these initials steeped in tradition. The extraordinarily dynamic capabilities - both on and off the road - and the powerful appearance of the Skoda Kodiaq RS complement the sporty lifestyle of a constantly growing target group in the SUV segment excellently.\r\n\r\nThe Skoda Kodiaq RS is the sporty top-of-the-range model and the dynamic driving performance is worthy of this status. The Skoda Kodiaq RS can accelerate from a standing start to 100 km/h in just seven seconds and has a top speed of 220 km/h. The engine\'s tractive power at lower engine speeds is also impressive: maximum torque is already available between 1,750 and 2,500 rpm. Fuel consumption of just 6 l of diesel per 100 km illustrates the engine\'s high level of efficiency. CO2 emissions are 157 g/km. A variety of technical factors make this possible: the biturbo engine in theŠkoda Kodiaq RS features direct injection, a Stop-Start system and brake energy recovery, for example. It also has a sophisticated thermo-management system, which swiftly brings the engine up to operating temperature once the ignition is switched on.',

In mid-2019 the time has now come: The EQC (combined power consumption: 22.2 kWh/100 km; combined CO2 emissions: 0 g/km, provisional figures)1 is the first Mercedes-Benz vehicle to be launched under the EQ brand. With its seamless, clear design and colour highlights typical of the brand, it is a pioneer for an avant-garde electric look while representing the design idiom of Progressive Luxury. With respect to quality, safety and comfort the EQC is the Mercedes-Benz among electric vehicles, and highly convincing in the sum of its attributes. These are accompanied by dynamic performance, thanks to two electric motors at the front and rear axles with a combined output of 300 kW. A sophisticated operating strategy enables an electric range of more than 450 km according to NEDC (provisional figure)1. EQ also offers comprehensive services with Mercedes me, and makes electromobility convenient and suitable for day-to-day motoring. The EQC also symbolises the start of a new mobility era at Daimler.\r\n\r\nAs the first Mercedes-Benz model under the new product and technology brand EQ, the Mercedes-Benz EQC has many trailblazing design details and colour highlights typical of the brand. Both inside and out, the EQC embodies the design idiom of Progressive Luxury. This arises from the combination of a previously unknown beauty, the conscious clash of digital and analogue elements as well as the seamless merging of intuitive and physical design.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of its muscular proportions, the EQC is classed as a crossover SUV. The extended roofline and window layout with a low waistline and the coupé-like roof recess at the rear visually position it between an SUV and an SUV coupé.\r\n\r\nA striking feature at the front is the large black-panel surface enclosing the headlamps and grille. For the first time, the black panel is bordered at the top by an optical fibre as a visual link between the torch-like daytime running lamps as a typical Mercedes-Benz feature. At night this creates an almost uninterrupted, horizontal light band. The inner housings and tubes of the standard MULTIBEAM LED headlamps are in high-gloss black. Contrasting colour highlights discreetly confirm the model\'s membership of the new EQ family: blue stripes on a black background, and MULTIBEAM lettering also in blue.\r\n\r\nThe high-quality interior of the EQC also pioneers an avant-garde electro-look. One example is the ribbed edge of the instrument panel, which resembles the cooling ribs of a hi-fi amplifier. The instrument panel is designed as a driver-oriented cockpit. The typical Mercedes-Benz wing profile is asymmetrical, with a “cut-out” in the driver area. This is where one of the visual highlights of the cockpit is located - a high-tech, high gloss cassette housing flat air vents with key-shaped, rosé-gold coloured louvres.',

The all-digital MMI touch response system provides intuitive operation and even more personalization. The extensive connectivity and assistance systems demonstrate intelligent automotive connectivity. The suspension combines smooth ride comfort and unshakable stability with enhanced sportiness. All engines use an efficient mild hybrid system.\r\n\r\nTo further enhance comfort and efficiency, all available engines in the new A6 are fitted with a mild hybrid system. This signifies that, after the A8 and the A7, Audi has now fully electrified a third model line. A belt alternator starter (BAS) works together with a lithium-ion battery with 10 Ah capacity. In combination with the six-cylinder engines, a 48V mild hybrid system is used. The A6 can coast between 55 and 160 km/h (34.2 and 99.4 mph) and the start-stop kicks in right from 22 km/h (13.7 mph). During deceleration, the BAS recovers up to 12 kW of energy. In real-world driving, the mild hybrid technology based on 48V reduces fuel consumption by up to 0.7 liters per 100 kilometers.\r\n\r\nLong journeys are the domain of the new Audi A6. With a generous amount of space, many convenience features and minimal interior noise, the business-class sedan pampers driver and passengers alike. Its interior is even larger than on the outgoing model – the A6 beats the core competitors in important criteria such as legroom in the rear.\r\n\r\nThe A6 is perfectly equipped for long journeys with new convenience functions. The seats are all-new. The top-of-the-line options include the customized contour front seats with numerous adjustment functions, optionally fitted with ventilation and massage function. The optional air quality package provides a subtle fragrance and improves the air with an ionizer. The optional panoramic glass sunroof floods the interior with light. The luggage compartment, with its capacity of 530 liters will accommodate two golf bags crosswise, while the trunk lid can be closed electrically with a kicking motion as an option.\r\n\r\nOn the sleek instrument panel of the new A6, a technical, futuristic black-panel design dominates which impressively combines form and function. The design language appears reduced and matter-of-fact; the horizontal lines create an airy sense of space. The center console and the two MMI touch response displays are angled slightly toward the driver. When switched off, the top display is incorporated almost invisibly into the dark decorative surface.\r\n\r\nThe wide range of colors and materials which Audi provides for the new A6 lend the interior design very different characteristics – from elegant through contemporary to sporty. Five interior trim lines are available with different color concepts: basic, sport, design, design selection and the S line sport package with 19-inch wheels and sport suspension. All elements, from the open-pore wood trim to the upholstery in Valcona leather, attest to the uncompromisingly high Audi quality. The S line exterior package is available as an option for all trim lines.\r\n',
