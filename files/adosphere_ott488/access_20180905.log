The first example of the breed was the BMW X5, making it the founding father of the BMW X model family and the market leader in the premium all-wheel drive segment - a status it maintains to this day. More than 2.2 million examples of the BMW X5 have been sold across its three model generations. And the new car puts down another marker in terms of design and technology. The new BMW X5 will again be built at BMW Plant Spartanburg in the US state of South Carolina. This centre of expertise for BMW X models also handles production of the BMW X3, BMW X4, BMW X6 - and will soon add the BMW X7 to its roster as well. ',

They’re definitely making it count, as the PB 18 e-tron is an incredible attempt to fuse the world of Audi’s successful Le Mans-winning prototypes to a production car. It features some pretty wild technology including a solid-state battery and a mix of light-weight materials like aluminum and carbon fiber. In contrast to many of the other concepts and debuts found throughout the industry, Audi claims this is a “Level Zero” on the SAE scale of automated vehicles, basically suggesting that this is an enthusiast-oriented, driver-focused vehicle. It has no heavy technology that assists with driving or comfort, and the driver’s seat can actually be moved to the center of the cockpit. That’s possible due to the steer and throttle by wire system which allows for the repositioning of the driver’s seat and controls. When the seat is slid all the way to the side, it can allow for a passenger, as there is a three-point seatbelt for safety.',

The RX created the luxury crossover segment 20 years ago and has reigned supreme as the most popular luxury utility vehicle on the market. The 2018 RX 350L and RX 450hL models retain their stylish figures, but now offer the choice of six or seven-passenger capability.\r\n\r\nWith the new Lexus RX L models, Lexus drivers will now have the option of a third row without compromising the sleek styling and easy maneuverability that they have long valued. With help through the mastery of vehicle packaging, Lexus extended the body length 4.3 inches (110 mm) at the rear and used a steeper tailgate window angle than on the two-row models - ensuring good headroom for third-row passengers.\r\n\r\nThe standard seven-seat version uses a 40/20/40 split bench-type second row seat. Access to the third row is made easy with the touch of a lever that slides and folds the second seat forward. The available six-seat configuration features second-row captain\'s chairs that make third-row ingress/egress easier with \"walk-in\" convenience.\r\n\r\nLexus designed the third row of the RX L models to offer the same comfort and luxury as in the middle row. The positioning of the second row is slightly higher than the third row, creating more foot room for rear passengers. Standard leather-trimmed upholstery is standard for the first and second rows, in the choice of Black, Stratus Gray, Parchment or Noble Brown. A tri-zone climate control system gives third-row passengers separate heating and air conditioning vents, and for convenience, a power-folding third-row seat and power tailgate are both standard on the RX L models.',

With its puristic, dynamic and progressive design language, the concept vehicle presented a vision of a charismatic sports car which, thanks to the production model, now becomes reality. Just a glance at the new BMW Z4’s proportions leaves no doubt about its dynamic potential. The central sitting position for the driver, the low centre of gravity, perfectly balanced 50 : 50 axle load distribution, wide tracks and a compact wheelbase form the ideal prerequisites for inspiringly agile handling and intense driving pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe BMW Z4 M40i First Edition fulfils these expectations in every aspect thanks to an extremely powerful 250 kW/340 hp, straight six-cylinder engine and a sports suspension with electronically controlled dampers, M Sport braking system and an electronically controlled M Sport differential in the rear axle transmission. The BMW M Performance automobile takes a mere 4.6 seconds to sprint from a standstill to 100 km/h.\r\n\r\nVertically aligned headlights, the BMW kidney grille sporting a mesh design, the bonnet stretching sports car-like over the wheels, large air breathers on the front wheel arches and the distinctive spoiler integrated into the rear lid all contribute towards the characteristic look of the new BMW Z4. The design of the interior also places the focus on the puristic sportiness of the new BMW Z4. The driver-oriented cockpit styling is underscored by dynamic forward-oriented lines. Likewise, the clearly structured arrangement of all control elements enhances the focus on the driving experience inside the new BMW Z4.',

With its puristic, dynamic and progressive design language, the concept vehicle presented a vision of a charismatic sports car which, thanks to the production model, now becomes reality. Just a glance at the new BMW Z4’s proportions leaves no doubt about its dynamic potential. The central sitting position for the driver, the low centre of gravity, perfectly balanced 50 : 50 axle load distribution, wide tracks and a compact wheelbase form the ideal prerequisites for inspiringly agile handling and intense driving pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe BMW Z4 M40i First Edition fulfils these expectations in every aspect thanks to an extremely powerful 250 kW/340 hp, straight six-cylinder engine and a sports suspension with electronically controlled dampers, M Sport braking system and an electronically controlled M Sport differential in the rear axle transmission. The BMW M Performance automobile takes a mere 4.6 seconds to sprint from a standstill to 100 km/h.\r\n\r\nVertically aligned headlights, the BMW kidney grille sporting a mesh design, the bonnet stretching sports car-like over the wheels, large air breathers on the front wheel arches and the distinctive spoiler integrated into the rear lid all contribute towards the characteristic look of the new BMW Z4. The design of the interior also places the focus on the puristic sportiness of the new BMW Z4. The driver-oriented cockpit styling is underscored by dynamic forward-oriented lines. Likewise, the clearly structured arrangement of all control elements enhances the focus on the driving experience inside the new BMW Z4.',

Thanks to this technology, the full range of vehicles, from MINI to Rolls-Royce, can now be quality-controlled even in the early stages of development. Scans are performed by four robots which move around the outside of the prototype to produce several thousand cross-sectional images. These are then used for detailed examinations of innovations, new materials and bonding technologies. Until now, vehicles have had to be dismantled for analysis, but CT allows checks to be carried out with the vehicle completely intact. The new X-ray system is based in the BMW Group Pilot Plant in the Research & Innovation Centre (FIZ) in Munich, at the intersection between Development and Production.\r\n\r\nUdo Hänle, head of Production Integration and Pilot Plant: “The use of this state-of-the-art computer tomography system is a major step forward for us as it will help us to improve the quality of our products even further. We can now analyse our prototypes in minute detail without having to dismantle them first. The new system allows us to examine our vehicles in a way that wouldn\'t be possible with conventional, static computer tomography systems. Ultimately, this will enable us to integrate new technologies into a series vehicles even faster.”',

That is exactly what the new SEAT Ibiza and Arona are, just like Beats by Dr. Dre, a brand that has changed the way people listen to music. SEAT and Beats started their collaboration last year, offering BeatsAudio as an option for various models of the range – Mii, Ibiza, Leon, Arona and Ateca. Now the collaboration between SEAT and Beats takes another step forward with the launch of two exclusive versions of its most youthful and urban models: the Ibiza and the Arona Beats.\r\n\r\nThe SEAT Ibiza and Arona Beats will be presented to the public for the first time during the Primavera Sound, a leading music festival for which SEAT is a strategic partner. Through this alliance with Primavera Sound, SEAT strengthens its commitment to music and its ties with its hometown, Barcelona, where the carmaker also participates at world-level events such as the Mobile World Congress or the Smart City Congress.',
