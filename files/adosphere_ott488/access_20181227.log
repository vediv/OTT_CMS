The carbon fibre fairing envelopes the sleek and functional forms of the engine and frame like a second skin. The upper fairing, with its classic cut lines, makes tribute to design ethos of the nineteen-seventies, highlighted by the yellow colour of the plexiglass windscreen and the headlight unit. The latter is a technologically advanced twin-function full LED poly- ellipsoidal. The daylight running light, also LED, is built into the cover of the new instrument cluster. The elusive, lightweight and minimalistic tail fairing rests on a new sub-frame allowing the user to transform the bike from a single seat to a dual seat version. One of the defining details is the new circular LED tail light unit, elegant, and distinctive.',

As compared to the previous Panamera GTS with a naturally aspirated 4.8-liter V8, the current engine offers an increase of 13 horsepower and an additional 73 lb.-ft. of torque. The engine, which sends power to all four wheels through an eight-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission via the standard Porsche Traction Management (PTM) all-wheel drive system, allows both the Porsche Panamera GTS and Porsche Panamera GTS Sport Turismo models to accelerate from 0 to 60 MPH in 3.9 seconds.
