It was followed a year later by a second model version in the form of the BMW 2-Series Gran Tourer, complete with a longer body, extended wheelbase and up to seven seats. By the end of 2017, these two models based on BMW\'s compact front-wheel-drive architecture had amassed in excess of 380,000 buyers, with almost 70 per cent opting for the Active Tourer. With conquest rates as high as 80 per cent, the majority of customers are new to the brand. The most important market is Germany, which absorbs about 25 per cent of total production. China is next up, followed by the UK. This success story is set to continue with the arrival of the updated models in March 2018.

Also with the model facelift, the previous “CDI” is replaced by the small letter “d”. The A 160 rated at 102 hp is the new entry-level model. Also new are the particularly efficient diesel version of the A 180 d BlueEFFICIENCY Edition with CO₂ emissions of 89 g/km, as well as the manual transmission versions of the dynamic A 250 and A 250 Sport models. The A 220 d now has a slightly higher output of 130 kW (177 hp), an increase of 5 kW (7 hp), while the A 250 Sport and A 250 Sport 4MATIC models now develop 160 kW (218 hp), up from the 155 kW (211 hp) generated previously. The agile, turbocharged four-cylinder engine of the new Mercedes-AMG A 45 4MATIC combines its power with a top efficiency figure: the output of 191 hp per litre marks a record for a series production four-cylinder engine. In combination with the 7G-DCT dual clutch transmission, the A-Class now features “Launch Assist” for even faster acceleration from a standstill. All in all, the model range comprises 17 versions (including the Mercedes-AMG A 45 4MATIC).',

The way Polestar 1 feels to drive and live with is also critical, according to Polestar’s Chief Executive Officer, Thomas Ingenlath.\r\n\r\nSteering responsiveness and torque vectoring calibration have taken priority in the latest tests, validating the chassis and suspension tuning carried out on earlier prototype cars in 2018.\r\n\r\nPolestar’s chief test driver, Joakim Rydholm, comments: “Whenever you drive Polestar 1, you should immediately feel like you are in control and that the car is ready to respond to your input, no matter what you want to do. This is a GT that needs to be easy to drive and comfortable in everyday use with its smooth and quiet hybrid drivetrain – but also ready to deliver its thrilling 600 hp and 1,000 Nm performance whenever the driver wants it.”\r\n\r\nThe next prototype phase, which starts early in 2019, includes the very first cars built in the soon-to-be-completed Polestar Production Centre in Chengdu, China.
