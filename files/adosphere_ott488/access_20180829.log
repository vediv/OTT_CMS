China is currently ranked as the largest market for all-electric vehicles, though countries like the US and Norway are also growing considerably, often triggered by government incentives such as subsidies and exemption from toll and parking fees. \r\n\r\nAccording to recent reports by ‘The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders’ (SMMT), many British drivers are still mistrustful or confused when it comes to pure electric cars. Research has shown that more than 52% of consumers are interested in purchasing electric cars, but hesitate due to concerns such finding a charging spot, or not feeling like they know enough about how an EV actually works. \r\n\r\nAs a result, Jaguar has teamed up with Presenter and Creator of Fully Charged Show Robert Llewelyn, to help customers realise the benefits and simplicity of actually owning an electric vehicle.

As it builds a unique picture of a vehicle’s use, the app will even show how many journeys, if any, would have needed a stop to charge the EV’s advanced Lithium-ion battery. Journeys over 50 miles represent only two per cent of all UK trips*. I-PACE, which has a maximum range of 298 miles (WLTP), could complete 98 per cent of these using just a fraction of a single charge. When opening the app, users can enter the real-world fuel economy of their existing vehicle to calculate the cost savings switching to the I-PACE would deliver. Once enough journeys have been logged, the app will estimate the range drivers can expect to achieve from a full charge. An interactive map allows users to search for the nearest charging points along a chosen route or within a local area. Compatible with Apple operating systems, the Go I-PACE app runs in the background and uses the device’s location services to track individual journeys. It can also distinguish between different modes of transport to make sure it collects accurate data, even prompting users to confirm that individual trips were made by car for unusual routes – for instance on journeys made by cycling rather than behind the wheel.',

This time is used to study the geometry of the ducts and vents in 3D, and virtual simulations are performed to predict how the air will flow inside the car. Nevertheless, people still make mistakes when using the air conditioning. Below are five of the most common ones and a few tips on how to make better use of it.',
