The BMW 8-Series Coupe is a dream car boasting outstanding performance, emotion-stirring design, state-of-the-art luxury and exceptionally advanced equipment features when it comes to display and control technology, driver assistance and connectivity.\r\n\r\nThe worldwide market launch of the new BMW 8-Series Coupe will commence in November 2018. The sports car will be built at the BMW Dingolfing plant, which is also home to the BMW 7-Series sedans meaning that it has acquired tremendous expertise in the manufacture of luxury vehicles. The digit 8 in the model name is indicative of the newcomer\'s high-ranking status within BMW\'s product range. As in the past with the BMW Z8 and also with the current BMW i8, it is reserved for exceptionally sporty cars that fire the emotions. The BMW 8-Series Coupe will therefore be a key component of the luxury segment model offensive set out by the BMW Group as part of its NUMBER ONE > NEXT strategy.\r\n\r\nThe primary development objective for the new BMW 8-Series Coupe was thrilling driving dynamics. Body, powertrain and suspension were consistently honed to achieve the supreme agility, precision and poise expected of a top-class sports car. In the process, remarkably powerful engines were combined with the BMW xDrive intelligent all-wheel-drive system and BMW EfficientLightweight design measures. The new BMW 8-Series Coupe was developed in parallel to the BMW M8 GTE, which had already proven its potential in the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) long-distance races and in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC) held in North America. The production car now makes it possible to experience outstandingly dynamic performance in an exceedingly luxurious setting.',

The design icon takes the stage with a sporty and refined exterior design, higher-powered engines and an extended scope of standard equipment.\r\n\r\nThe first generation of the Audi TT made its series premiere in 1998. Three years before, Audi had already presented the TT as a concept car – a Coupé was shown at the IAA in Frankfurt and a Roadster was presented at the Tokyo Motor Show. Within a short time after the market launch, the TT Coupé had moved to the top of the segment.\r\n\r\nThe Audi TT stands for driving pleasure, design and close attention to detail: aluminum elements in the driver-oriented interior, progressive rim design, a short, ball-shaped gear lever knob, characteristic tank flap and round, dual-branch tailpipes are among the typical features of this compact sports car. The design with its incisive geometric forms has fans all over the world.',

The Saloon, Estate, Coupé and Cabriolet (combined fuel consumption: 10.4-9.9 l/100 km; combined CO2 emissions: 236-227 g/km)[1] now feature a sharper exterior, a modernised interior and even more agility. The fast-shifting AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 9G transmission, the electronically controlled rear-axle differential, and the nine-stage AMG TRACTION CONTROL (in the C 63 S) take longitudinal and lateral dynamics to a new level. AMG DYNAMICS enhances driving pleasure, too: this built-in dynamic handling control extends the functions of the ESP, allowing precisely measured torque distribution on the rear axle (Torque Vectoring), which increases agility while maintaining a high level of stability. The new C 63 has a more emotive look, too: the AMG-specific radiator trim underscores the brand identity while emphasising the muscular appearance. The interior benefits from an optional fully digital cockpit with unmistakable AMG displays and the new generation of AMG steering wheels.\r\n\r\nThe C 63 is the bedrock of Mercedes-AMG. Drivers and fans love it because it is one of a kind in its segment. Its signature feature is the immensely powerful eight-cylinder engine ‑ no other model in the competitive environment can pick from such an embarrassment of riches. The V8 is an unshakeable part of the AMG brand identity. The rear-wheel drive, the AMG-specific suspension and the athletic overall appearance likewise set the C 63 apart from its competitors. It also offers a wealth of individualisation options, including four body versions, two output variants and an extensive range of optional extras.',
