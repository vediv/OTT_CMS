The new 911 celebrated its world premiere on the eve of the L.A. Auto Show. It continues to set the standard when it comes to exclusive sportiness. Unmistakably committed to the Porsche design DNA, a much more muscular look, and an interior featuring a 10.9-inch touchscreen monitor, the new 911 is timeless – and modern. Intelligent control and chassis elements as well as innovative assistance systems combine the masterfully uncompromising dynamism that the classic rear-engine sportscar is famed for, with the demands of the digital world.\r\n\r\nThe next generation of flat-six turbocharged engines has been further developed and is more powerful than ever before, with 331 kW (450 PS) in the S models. The drive efficiency has been increased by way of an improved injection process and a new layout for the turbochargers and charge air cooling system. The power is delivered by a newly developed eight-speed dual-clutch transmission. Additional highlights include the new assistance systems, including Porsche Wet mode to make driving on wet roads even safer, and Night Vision Assist with thermal imaging camera, as well as comprehensive connectivity – which now also uses swarm intelligence. The 911’s features are rounded off by three exclusive digital offerings: the Porsche Road Trip app for extraordinary tours, the Porsche 360+ personal assistant, and the web-based Porsche Impact emissions calculator for neutralising your individual carbon footprint.',

The fully redesigned model will be rolled out to global markets starting from North America in early 2019. The all-new Mazda3 will be on display at the Los Angeles Auto Show, open to the public from Nov. 30 through Dec. 9.1\r\n\r\nThe all-new Mazda3 adopts a matured Kodo design language that attempts to embody the essence of Japanese aesthetics. While the overall form presents a simple, single motion, subtle undulations bring the design to life through shifting light and reflections that glide over the body surface. The result is a richer and more powerful expression of vitality than previous Kodo models. Despite sharing the Mazda3 moniker, the hatchback and sedan models have distinct personalities—the design of the hatchback is emotive, the sedan elegant.\r\n\r\nThe all-new Mazda3 adopts Mazda’s new Skyactiv-Vehicle Architecture, designed to enable people to make the most of their natural sense of balance. The powertrain lineup comprises the latest Skyactiv-X, Skyactiv-G and Skyactiv-D engines, each of which provides responsive speed control in any driving situation. Based on its philosophy of designing the car around the human being, Mazda has dramatically enhanced the car’s fundamental driving attributes such that accelerating, turning and braking feel completely natural.\r\n\r\nHaving sold over 6 million units2 since its 2003 debut, the all-new Mazda3 is a global strategic model that has driven Mazda’s growth from both a brand and business perspective. It has delivered Mazda’s renowned driving pleasure to customers all over the world and been a mainstay of production at key plants globally.',

After being shunted out of contention by another competitor, works driver Laurens Vanthoor was unable to take part in the race. His Porsche 911 GT3 R had been too badly damaged by a crash into the barriers.\r\n\r\nShortly after the start, Bamber (New Zealand) launched a pursuit of the leaders, but found insufficient space to overtake. Instead, the New Zealander safeguarded his tyres in preparation for the final stage of the ca. 110-kilometre race over 18 laps. This strategy paid off. In the closing phase, Bamber was the fastest driver on the 6.115-kilometre racetrack. However, the narrow street circuit left no room for a successful attack on the leading vehicles.

It continues to set the standard when it comes to exclusive sportiness. Unmistakably committed to the Porsche design DNA, a much more muscular look, and an interior featuring a 10.9-inch touchscreen monitor, the new 911 is timeless - and modern. Intelligent control and chassis elements as well as innovative assistance systems combine the masterfully uncompromising dynamism that the classic rear-engine sportscar is famed for, with the demands of the digital world.\r\n\r\nThe next generation of flat-six turbocharged engines has been further developed and is more powerful than ever before, with 331 kW (450 PS) in the S models. The drive efficiency has been increased by way of an improved injection process and a new layout for the turbochargers and charge air cooling system. The power is delivered by a newly developed eight-speed dual-clutch transmission. Additional highlights include the new assistance systems, including Porsche Wet mode to make driving on wet roads even safer, and Night Vision Assist with thermal imaging camera, as well as comprehensive connectivity - which now also uses swarm intelligence. The 911\'s features are rounded off by three exclusive digital offerings: the Porsche Road Trip app for extraordinary tours, the Porsche 360+ personal assistant, and the web-based Porsche Impact emissions calculator for neutralising your individual carbon footprint.',

While the overall form presents a simple, single motion, subtle undulations bring the design to life through shifting light and reflections that glide over the body surface. The result is a richer and more powerful expression of vitality than previous Kodo models. Despite sharing the Mazda3 moniker, the hatchback and sedan models have distinct personalities—the design of the hatchback is emotive, the sedan elegant.\r\n\r\nThe all-new Mazda3 adopts Mazda’s new Skyactiv-Vehicle Architecture, designed to enable people to make the most of their natural sense of balance. The powertrain lineup comprises the latest Skyactiv-X, Skyactiv-G and Skyactiv-D engines, each of which provides responsive speed control in any driving situation. Based on its philosophy of designing the car around the human being, Mazda has dramatically enhanced the car’s fundamental driving attributes such that accelerating, turning and braking feel completely natural.\r\n\r\nHaving sold over 6 million units2 since its 2003 debut, the all-new Mazda3 is a global strategic model that has driven Mazda’s growth from both a brand and business perspective.
