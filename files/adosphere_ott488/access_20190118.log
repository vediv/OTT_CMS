Acceleration off the line is linear, smooth and swift. Responsiveness has never felt so supple. The low, centrally-mounted battery pack gives the Revero an exceptionally low center of gravity and near 50:50 weight distribution. The auto-leveling suspension system adjusts its stance when it needs to for perfect poise in all road conditions. The Revero’s Lithium-ion battery powers its electric motors to turn the rear wheels – giving up to 50 miles of pure-electric driving range. After that, the gas-powered generator engages to propel the vehicle. Should you find yourself at the end of the Revero’s 300-mile range, you have flexibility: you may recharge the lithium-ion battery or simply fill the gasoline tank and continue on to your destination. The solar roof not only charges the 12V battery, but also charges the highvoltage battery, adding to the electric range. Its unique pattern isn’t just for show. The solar roof was developed for maximum efficiency by optimizing sunlight angles.',
