The latest vehicles complement Eden’s existing Renault Twizys. The quadricycles’ compact dimensions make them ideal for use across the entire Eden site – even in the narrow pathways through the tranquil, climate-controlled Biomes.\r\n\r\nThe usability and high visibility of its previous Renault EVs has allowed the Eden Project to lead by example when it comes to raising awareness of the benefits of electric vehicles in reducing carbon emissions. Compared to equivalent diesel and petrol vehicles, its original Renault EV fleet saved nearly 17 tonnes of CO2 since its inception in 2016, clocking up nearly 94,000 miles in and around its award-winning facility.',

In the new Volkswagen Polo GTI the engine starter button becomes the trigger for a great driving experience, as the development team has created a style of dynamic handling that facilitates committed driving and yet integrates supreme safety and high levels of comfort. This alliance of dynamism, safety and comfort is the secret behind the success of the GTI concept and a core characteristic of the new Polo GTI. Key features: very agile drive system, low unladen weight (1,355 kg) and power-to-weight ratio (6.78 kg/PS), firm sports-oriented running gear that is also good for long-distance driving, assured front-wheel drive and an ergonomically ideal sitting position. This is all packaged in an expressive exterior and interior design. Topped off with classic GTI insignia such as the typical red stripe in the radiator grille, the GTI gear knob and the legendary \'Clark\' plaid seat covers. Equipped with a connected and largely digitalised cockpit, the Polo GTI, always offered in four-door format, is thus ideal as the compact, affordable sports car of a new generation.',

That is because the success of the Golf - along with its technical concept and all-round qualities - has always been based on a design that is considered unmistakable and extends beyond class boundaries.

The Atlas Tanoak concept shows that MQB can potentially stretch even further. The Tanoak concept is 214.1 inches long, some 15.8 inches longer than the Atlas, which makes it a large midsize pickup by U.S. standards.

Named after a species of tree that is native to the Pacific Coast in the U.S. (and grows up to 135 feet high in height), the Atlas Tanoak is the first pickup based on Volkswagen’s MQB or modular transverse matrix architecture. Powered by a 276-horsepower V6 FSI gasoline engine, the Atlas Tanoak uses an efficient eight-speed automatic transmission and the 4MOTION all-wheel-drive system. Although there are currently no production plans for the Atlas Tanoak, Volkswagen is keen to gauge the reactions of buyers and media, since pickup trucks are one of the biggest volume segments in the U.S. The MQB architecture is one of the most innovative and flexible technical platforms in the automotive world, spanning vehicles from the European Polo subcompact all the way up to the Atlas midsize SUV. The Atlas Tanoak concept shows that MQB can potentially stretch even further. The Tanoak concept is 214.1 inches long, some 15.8 inches longer than the Atlas, which makes it a large midsize pickup by U.S. standards. The concept vehicle is 79.9 inches wide and 72.6 inches tall, with a wheelbase of 128.3 inches, 11 inches longer than the Atlas seven-seater.',

For high engine efficiency, power and torque, the V6 engine uses a centrally mounted fuel injector and a combustion method with shorter compression and longer expansion phases.

For this reason alone it is the most exciting weekend of the year.”\r\n\r\nThe track in the Spanish metropolis is Ekström’s favorite. On his premiere in 2015, he made a mistake in the semi-final at the extremely fast first corner, which cost him a possible win. In both 2016 and 2017, the Audi driver was however unbeatable in Spain. “Barcelona is the highlight of the year for me,” says Ekström. “When you charge towards Turn 7 – former Turn 1 – and see the many fans in the grandstands you get goose bumps. You take this corner almost flat out in fifth gear at around 150 to 160 km/h. I love the general layout of the track.”',

But is the story fiction or reality? Adventurer Sebastian Canaves traces the steps of the famous vampire in Romanian Transylvania. More than a hundred years have passed since British writer Bram Stoker unleashed his Gothic novel about Dracula, an undead soul who leaves his grave every night to hunt for human blood. Since that time, the vampire count has been considered one of the world’s most feared beings.\r\n\r\nStoker’s tale was inspired by the historical figure of 15th-century Wallachian prince Vlad III, also known as Drăculea, a name traditionally thought to derive from his father’s membership of the aristocratic Order of the Dragon, and possibly meaning “Son of the Dragon” – or even “Son of the Devil”.\r\n\r\nAnd it’s not just a name that the two figures have in common. Vlad III retains a reputation as a fearsome commander with a predilection for cruel rituals: bloodthirsty, apparently invulnerable, and responsible for countless atrocities during the Middle Ages... So how much truth is there in the Count Dracula story?',
