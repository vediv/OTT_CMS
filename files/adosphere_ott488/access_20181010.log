And if that\'s not enough, there\'s a Polestar-Engineered version with 415 hp and a hefty 494 lb-ft of torque. According to Automotive News, the S60 T8 Polestar Engineered will do 0-60 mph in 4.3 seconds. That doesn\'t make it an all-out BMW M3-fighter, but it does put this S60 on par with all-wheel drive sports sedans like the Audi S4 and Mercedes-AMG C43—which do 0-60 mph in 4.3 and 4.1 seconds, respectively, per Car and Driver—all while offering subtle good looks that\'ll totally fly under the radar. The Polestar upgrades don\'t stop at engine tuning, either.

The engine found in the Skoda Kodiaq RS produces 176 kW (240 PS), making it the most powerful production diesel in the history of Skoda. It offers a particularly emotive engine note thanks to Dynamic Sound Boost - which is making its debut in a Skoda. This perfectly complements the power of the Skoda Kodiaq RS, which holds the lap record for seven-seater SUVs on the Nürburgring\'s Nordschleife with a time of 9 minutes, 29.84 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe initials RS now represent the perfect combination of a sporty driving experience and excellent suitability for daily use. The Skoda Kodiaq RS is now the brand\'s first ever SUV to bear these initials steeped in tradition. The extraordinarily dynamic capabilities - both on and off the road - and the powerful appearance of the Skoda Kodiaq RS complement the sporty lifestyle of a constantly growing target group in the SUV segment excellently.\r\n\r\nThe Skoda Kodiaq RS is the sporty top-of-the-range model and the dynamic driving performance is worthy of this status. The Skoda Kodiaq RS can accelerate from a standing start to 100 km/h in just seven seconds and has a top speed of 220 km/h. The engine\'s tractive power at lower engine speeds is also impressive: maximum torque is already available between 1,750 and 2,500 rpm. Fuel consumption of just 6 l of diesel per 100 km illustrates the engine\'s high level of efficiency. CO2 emissions are 157 g/km. A variety of technical factors make this possible: the biturbo engine in theŠkoda Kodiaq RS features direct injection, a Stop-Start system and brake energy recovery, for example. It also has a sophisticated thermo-management system, which swiftly brings the engine up to operating temperature once the ignition is switched on.',

The brand’s range on display was vast as it was versatile. Kicking things off is the highly-anticipated new Audi Q3. The small SUV has grown in all dimensions, save for its height, and packs in new tech like the virtual cockpit and dual-zone climate control. Alongside the new Q3 was Audi\'s first ever SUV with an all-electric drivetrain. Yes, we\'re talking about the e-Tron which Audi seems keen on bringing to India as early as 2020. Aside from offering a quick 0-100kmph time of under 6 seconds, it also has a claimed range of around 400km. Of course, you can expect a heap of Audi luxury inside too. Another SUV that debuted at the Paris Motor Show was Audi\'s SQ2. This little pocket rocket is what happens when you put a really powerful engine in a small, lightweight body. It\'s powered by a 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine that makes a whopping 300PS of power and 400Nm of torque. That\'s enough for a 0-100 time of 4.8 seconds. Audi also showcased an updated version of their R8 GT3 racecar. Called the Evo, this version is available as a whole car, or as a kit for existing owners of the GT3. Audi also presented their entry-level hatchback, the A1. Based on the same platform as the Polo, this little thing makes anywhere between 90-150 horsepower and is the starting point for new Audi buyers.',

One has all the established strengths of Toyota’s fourth generation system, including improved responsiveness, more linear acceleration, fuel efficiency and a relaxing drive; the other builds on these qualities with more power on demand, effortless acceleration and more dynamic, “fun to drive” characteristics.\r\n\r\nBoth the Hatchback and Touring Sports will be available with a single conventional engine option – a 114bhp 1.2-litre turbo petrol unit. The hybrid choices will be 120bhp 1.8 litre or 178bhp 2.0-litre systems.\r\n\r\nThe 1.8 delivers everything customers have come to expect from a self-charging Toyota hybrid electric powertrain: quiet, intuitive and responsive performance with low cost of ownership and greater reliability than any conventional car engine. The system provides outstanding fuel economy and low CO2 emissions and doesn’t require connection to a power source for recharging.\r\n\r\nThe 2.0-litre system rewards customers with all the benefits above while also offering a more “energised” drive, with more power and steering-wheel mounted paddle shifts. It allows Corolla to fully exploit the comfort, stability and handling qualities inherent in its new Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) GA-C platform.',

The top-of-the-line S60, the T8 hybrid, offers 400 hp from a turbo- and supercharged four-cylinder driving the front wheels plus an electric motor at the rear axle. And if that\'s not enough, there\'s a Polestar-Engineered version with 415 hp and a hefty 494 lb-ft of torque. According to Automotive News, the S60 T8 Polestar Engineered will do 0-60 mph in 4.3 seconds. That doesn\'t make it an all-out BMW M3-fighter, but it does put this S60 on par with all-wheel drive sports sedans like the Audi S4 and Mercedes-AMG C43—which do 0-60 mph in 4.3 and 4.1 seconds, respectively, per Car and Driver—all while offering subtle good looks that\'ll totally fly under the radar. The Polestar upgrades don\'t stop at engine tuning, either. The S60 T8 Polestar Engineered gets new dampers designed in partnership with Öhlins, big Brembo brakes behind 19-inch forged wheels, and a strut-tower brace under the hood. There\'s also some styling upgrades inside and out to signify to those in the know that this is no ordinary Volvo.',

The heavily contoured powerdomes on the long bonnet allude to the powerful unit housed underneath it, while the broad wings make the dynamic potential of the AMG GT 4-Door Coupé distinctly visible. As with the two-door AMG GT models, a radiator blind, the so-called AIRPANEL, positioned in front of the central radiator air inlet improves the vehicle\'s aerodynamic efficiency according to requirements. The striking front splitter reduces lift on the front axle.\r\n\r\nCharacteristic Coupé architectural features include the frameless side windows and the flat windscreen which is drawn widely towards the rear. Even from the side perspective, the \"shark nose\" design looks especially dynamic and feisty. The tapered side line and the broad shoulders hint at the athletic and sporty orientation of the vehicle. Depending on the engine version, the heavily pronounced wheel housings are home to a broad range of 19 and 20-inch light-alloy wheels, not to mention optional 21-inch forged wheels, all of which provide a high degree of personalisation.',

The fresh arrivals introduce the brand’s new design language to a number of vehicle segments and represent significant advances in the areas of digitalisation, operation, sustainability and driving dynamics. For example, visitors to the Paris show will discover the first models to feature the new BMW Operating System 7.0, which creates a fully digital grouping of instrument cluster and Control Display and allows system operation to be adapted even more precisely to the driver’s personal preferences.\r\n\r\nThe BMW Group is set to revolutionise driving pleasure with the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant.

This will mark the start of a new era for the BMW Group in which drivers will increasingly be able to operate their car and access its functions and information simply by speaking.

The instrument panel is broken up by sweeping horizontal lines, which combine with classy electroplated trim elements to emphasize the width of the interior. And with its large trim finisher and surrounds likewise made up of electroplated elements, the centre console - rising up to the instrument panel - also contributes to the handsome overall impression.\r\n\r\nThe raised seating position, driver-focused cockpit and new design and arrangement of the controls offer the person at the wheel the best possible view of proceedings and enable him or her to maintain supreme control over the task of driving. The fully-digital instrument cluster and the Control Display are connected visually by consistency of design and also share the same graphics. The centre console hosts the Controller, the newly designed transmission selector lever and all other driving-related controls - i.e. the Driving Experience Control switch, the start/stop button and the buttons to activate the air suspension settings and off-road modes (if specified). A similarly new-look control panel for the heating and air conditioning is also on hand, and the light functions in the new X5 are likewise operated using buttons.\r\n\r\nThe carefully selected materials in the interior include the new Vernasca variant for the standard leather upholstery. Like the optional BMW Individual extended Merino leather trim, it is available in five colours. The new BMW X5 is fitted as standard with electrically adjustable and heated sports seats. Customers can also specify optional multifunction seats with massage function and seat ventilation for the driver and front passenger.',

In mid-2019 the time has now come: The EQC (combined power consumption: 22.2 kWh/100 km; combined CO2 emissions: 0 g/km, provisional figures)1 is the first Mercedes-Benz vehicle to be launched under the EQ brand. With its seamless, clear design and colour highlights typical of the brand, it is a pioneer for an avant-garde electric look while representing the design idiom of Progressive Luxury. With respect to quality, safety and comfort the EQC is the Mercedes-Benz among electric vehicles, and highly convincing in the sum of its attributes. These are accompanied by dynamic performance, thanks to two electric motors at the front and rear axles with a combined output of 300 kW. A sophisticated operating strategy enables an electric range of more than 450 km according to NEDC (provisional figure)1. EQ also offers comprehensive services with Mercedes me, and makes electromobility convenient and suitable for day-to-day motoring. The EQC also symbolises the start of a new mobility era at Daimler.\r\n\r\nAs the first Mercedes-Benz model under the new product and technology brand EQ, the Mercedes-Benz EQC has many trailblazing design details and colour highlights typical of the brand. Both inside and out, the EQC embodies the design idiom of Progressive Luxury. This arises from the combination of a previously unknown beauty, the conscious clash of digital and analogue elements as well as the seamless merging of intuitive and physical design.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of its muscular proportions, the EQC is classed as a crossover SUV. The extended roofline and window layout with a low waistline and the coupé-like roof recess at the rear visually position it between an SUV and an SUV coupé.\r\n\r\nA striking feature at the front is the large black-panel surface enclosing the headlamps and grille. For the first time, the black panel is bordered at the top by an optical fibre as a visual link between the torch-like daytime running lamps as a typical Mercedes-Benz feature. At night this creates an almost uninterrupted, horizontal light band. The inner housings and tubes of the standard MULTIBEAM LED headlamps are in high-gloss black. Contrasting colour highlights discreetly confirm the model\'s membership of the new EQ family: blue stripes on a black background, and MULTIBEAM lettering also in blue.\r\n\r\nThe high-quality interior of the EQC also pioneers an avant-garde electro-look. One example is the ribbed edge of the instrument panel, which resembles the cooling ribs of a hi-fi amplifier. The instrument panel is designed as a driver-oriented cockpit. The typical Mercedes-Benz wing profile is asymmetrical, with a “cut-out” in the driver area. This is where one of the visual highlights of the cockpit is located - a high-tech, high gloss cassette housing flat air vents with key-shaped, rosé-gold coloured louvres.',

The BMW X5 M50d is powered by a six-cylinder in-line diesel engine with a quartet of turbochargers. A six-cylinder in-line unit can also be found under the bonnet of the BMW X5 xDrive40i and BMW X5 xDrive30d. All the engines channel their power through an eight-speed Steptronic transmission, while BMW xDrive intelligent all-wheel drive is on hand to ensure that power is translated into secure progress - on or off road.\r\n\r\nThe BMW TwinPower Turbo technology package for the petrol engines comprises turbochargers, High Precision Injection, VALVETRONIC fully variable valve timing and Double-VANOS variable camshaft timing. On the diesel side, the raft of technological measures at work includes turbochargers and common-rail direct injection with piezo injectors. The result is instantaneous pulling power and sporty performance credentials on the one hand and exemplary fuel consumption and emissions on the other. All model variants comply with the requirements of the EU6d-TEMP emissions standard. The system of emission control for the petrol engines includes a gasoline particulate filter that minimises particulate emissions, while the diesel models boast BMW BluePerformance technology comprising a particulate filter, an oxidation catalyst, a NOx adsorption catalyst and an SCR catalyst with AdBlue injection to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions.',

The all-new Corolla, built at Toyota’s Burnaston factory in the UK, has a more dynamic look with stronger differentiation between the compact, sporty hatch and the sleek, refined Touring Sports wagon.\r\n\r\nThe Touring Sports body style, created and developed in Europe, is a key model for fleet sales, commanding a growing share of the market.\r\n\r\nToyota has more than 20 years of hybrid technical leadership and has amassed more than 12 million global hybrid vehicle sales – including 1.5 million in Europe. The 2018 Corolla establishes another landmark in its development of the technology with the debut of Toyota’s dual hybrid strategy, adding a new 2.0-litre self-charging hybrid electric powertrain to the range.\r\n\r\nToyota has responded to feedback from potential customers who want more power when driving a hybrid car, moving to offer its core models with a choice of two hybrid powertrains. One has all the established strengths of Toyota’s fourth generation system, including improved responsiveness, more linear acceleration, fuel efficiency and a relaxing drive; the other builds on these qualities with more power on demand, effortless acceleration and more dynamic, “fun to drive” characteristics.',

The engine found in the Skoda Kodiaq RS produces 176 kW (240 PS), making it the most powerful production diesel in the history of Skoda. It offers a particularly emotive engine note thanks to Dynamic Sound Boost - which is making its debut in a Skoda. This perfectly complements the power of the Skoda Kodiaq RS, which holds the lap record for seven-seater SUVs on the Nürburgring\'s Nordschleife with a time of 9 minutes, 29.84 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe initials RS now represent the perfect combination of a sporty driving experience and excellent suitability for daily use. The Skoda Kodiaq RS is now the brand\'s first ever SUV to bear these initials steeped in tradition. The extraordinarily dynamic capabilities - both on and off the road - and the powerful appearance of the Skoda Kodiaq RS complement the sporty lifestyle of a constantly growing target group in the SUV segment excellently.\r\n\r\nThe Skoda Kodiaq RS is the sporty top-of-the-range model and the dynamic driving performance is worthy of this status. The Skoda Kodiaq RS can accelerate from a standing start to 100 km/h in just seven seconds and has a top speed of 220 km/h. The engine\'s tractive power at lower engine speeds is also impressive: maximum torque is already available between 1,750 and 2,500 rpm. Fuel consumption of just 6 l of diesel per 100 km illustrates the engine\'s high level of efficiency. CO2 emissions are 157 g/km. A variety of technical factors make this possible: the biturbo engine in theŠkoda Kodiaq RS features direct injection, a Stop-Start system and brake energy recovery, for example. It also has a sophisticated thermo-management system, which swiftly brings the engine up to operating temperature once the ignition is switched on.',

The protagonist in question is the new BMW Z4, which will celebrate its show premiere in the French capital. The new version of the open-top two-seater exudes pure sporting pedigree at first glance with its emotionally powerful body design in the brand’s new design language, its classical soft-top roof with electric operation and its driver-focused interior. The dynamic potential of the new BMW Z4 is rooted in a range of extensively upgraded engines, a new chassis design and an extremely rigid body structure. Wide tracks, well balanced proportions and a compact wheelbase enhance the car’s handling agility. And its central seating position, minimised weight and low centre of gravity provide a ticket to intense driving pleasure. The new BMW Operating System 7.0 takes control and operation to an even higher level and makes use of 10.25-inch colour displays for both the digital instrument cluster and central monitor.\r\n\r\nAt the pinnacle of the three-pronged Z4 range is a BMW M Performance model. The new BMW Z4 M40i (fuel consumption combined: 7.4 – 7.1 l/100 km [38.2 – 39.8 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions combined: 168 – 162 g/km) is fitted with a six-cylinder in-line engine developing 250 kW/340 hp, comes as standard with features including Adaptive M Sport suspension, variable sport steering, M Sport brakes, an electronically controlled M Sport rear differential, 18-inch M light-alloy wheels and high-performance tyres, and dispatches the sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in just 4.5 seconds.',

Off road the permanent all-wheel drive delivers excellent driving pleasure with optimum traction and supreme stability. Activated at the push of a button, the optional hill descent control maintains the preset speed on a steep downhill gradient.',

The new Ford Transit Custom PHEV has been revealed promising 30 miles of zero emissions range, with a claimed total range north of 300 with use of an on-board generator – a 1.0-litre EcoBoost engine. The front wheels are driven by an electric motor, which gets its power from a 14kWh liquid-cooled lithium-ion battery pack, which in turn gets its energy from either the mains, or by running the 1.0-litre engine. The PHEV will offer the same 1-tonne payload and load volume of a standard diesel powered Transit Custom. A charge port has been built into the front bumper, allowing the Custom PHEV to be recharged in five hours using a domestic 240-volt 10-amp power supply. This drops to three hours using a commercial 240 volt 16-amp or 32-amp supply.',
