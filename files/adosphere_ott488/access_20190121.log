This latest evolution of the popular compact SUV has been developed to exceed the expectations of customers, with enhanced and unique characteristics. The new CR-V now features a range of sophisticated technologies and superior quality throughout.\r\n\r\nIn a first for a Honda SUV in Europe, the all-new Honda CR-V will be available with advanced hybrid powertrain technology. The hybrid system uses intelligent Multi Mode Drive technology (i-MMD) combining two electric motors, an Atkinson-cycle petrol engine, Lithium-ion battery and a fixed-gear transmission to deliver high levels of refinement, responsiveness and efficiency. It is available in both FWD and AWD formats.\r\n\r\nThe CR-V has a fresh and sophisticated exterior design, with broader, muscular wheel arches, sharper contours on the bonnet and rear quarters, as well as the latest Honda family \'face\' with its signature headlight graphic.\r\n\r\nThe new model raises the bar in terms of interior quality, sophistication and spaciousness. Benchmarked against premium-brand products, it delivers improved ride quality, steering response, body control and NVH management. Evolved in every way, the all-new CR-V delivers more comfort, convenience and connectivity than ever before.\r\n\r\nThe all-new CR-V\'s slightly larger exterior proportions, longer wheelbase and wider stance enable a significantly larger interior. Best-in-class space efficiency is highlighted by the generous space available for all occupants, as well as a wider, deeper boot with a longer load bay. A hands-free power tailgate enables convenient loading access.',

Vitara has enjoyed strong UK sales success since launch in 2015 and it is currently the most popular model in the Suzuki range.\r\n\r\nFirstly, Suzuki Vitara will be available with both 1.0-litre and 1.4-litre Boosterjet turbo charged petrol engines as introduced in the S-Cross model range late last year and these will replace the 1.6-litre petrol engine. The highly acclaimed Boosterjet engines provide more power and torque, greater efficiency and offer lower emissions too. SZ4 and SZ-T grades are equipped with the 1.0-litre 111PS Boosterjet engine and ALLGRIP four wheel drive is available optionally on the SZ-T with manual transmission.\r\n\r\nSZ5 models are equipped with the 1.4-litre Boosterjet engine which offers a power output of 140PS and 220Nm of torque is available from just 1,500rpm through to 4,000rpm. WLTP fuel consumption and CO2 emission figures for both engines will be available closer to the launch date.\r\n\r\nThe latest Suzuki Vitara will also offer various design updates, two new colours and the availability of new technology and advanced safety equipment.\r\n\r\nFor the exterior, new design alloy wheels are available, a redesigned front grille and lower bumper is utilised and the rear of the car features new design and distinctive LED combination lamps. For the interior, the upper instrument panel now incorporates a soft touch material for added quality and the instrument cluster has a new design with colour central information display.\r\n\r\nThe 2019 Vitara will be the most technically advanced Suzuki to date and new safety technology available as standard equipment on the SZ5 model will include Dual Sensor Brake Support, Lane Departure Warning and Prevention, Traffic Sign recognition, Blind Spot Monitor and Rear cross traffic alert.',

Similarly, deformation of the footwell showed that the structure had reached the limit of its integrity. Although dummy readings indicated good protection of the knees and femurs of the driver and passenger dummy, structures in the dashboard were thought to present a risk to occupants of different sizes and to those sitting in different positions, and protection of this body area was rated as marginal. Dummy readings, together with the penalty applied for the unstable bodyshell, resulted in protection of the driver chest being rated as weak. In the full-width rigid barrier test, dummy readings of chest compression showed marginal protection of the driver chest. For the rear passenger, dummy readings showed weak protection of the neck and, combined with high shoulder-belt loads, poor protection of the chest. In the side barrier test, the Wrangler scored maximum points, with good protection of all critical body areas. No pole test was conducted on the Wrangler.

In addition to crash tests, aerodynamic evaluations and on-road testing, vital areas of assessment are chassis dynamics and the driver experience.\r\n\r\nFor Polestar, performance is about much more than just acceleration. The way Polestar 1 feels to drive and live with is also critical, according to Polestar’s Chief Executive Officer, Thomas Ingenlath.\r\n\r\nSteering responsiveness and torque vectoring calibration have taken priority in the latest tests, validating the chassis and suspension tuning carried out on earlier prototype cars in 2018.\r\n\r\nPolestar’s chief test driver, Joakim Rydholm, comments: “Whenever you drive Polestar 1, you should immediately feel like you are in control and that the car is ready to respond to your input, no matter what you want to do. This is a GT that needs to be easy to drive and comfortable in everyday use with its smooth and quiet hybrid drivetrain – but also ready to deliver its thrilling 600 hp and 1,000 Nm performance whenever the driver wants it.”\r\n\r\nThe next prototype phase, which starts early in 2019, includes the very first cars built in the soon-to-be-completed Polestar Production Centre in Chengdu, China. This will be the final prototype series before pre-production cars are built to final specification and quality standards.',

In conjunction with the versatile suspension, its low center of gravity and the powerful electric motors, the electric SUV offers powerful traction, outstanding dynamics and unshakable stability on disparate terrain.\r\nThe scenario: drifting across the sand flats and offroad through the savanna\r\nThe dried-out salt lake on the edge of the Kalahari Desert measures 2 by 2.3 kilometers (1.2 by 1.4 mi). Its porous, hard surface with fine-grained gravel offers a low coefficient of friction – optimal conditions to experience the Audi e-tron prototype in a controlled drift and get a feel for its lightning-fast acceleration coupled with high traction. This is possible thanks to the electric all-wheel drive and numerous suspension systems that are intelligently interconnected, most notably the Electronic Stabilization Control (ESC), the Audi drive select dynamic handling system and the standard air suspension. On rough terrain it increases the ground clearance of the Audi e-tron prototype at the push of a button by 50 millimeters (2.0 in). At the same time the ESC optimizes the traction and brake control and increases the effect of the electronic differential lock for optimum power transfer and propulsive power. As such, the electric SUV effortlessly takes even the sandy soil of the African savanna in its stride. The two electric motors provide the ideal power source for the high-precision, ultrafast electric quattro. In boost mode they provide up to 300 kW and a maximum 664 Nm (489.7 lb-ft) of torque. The effective thermal management plays a crucial role in their performance. It allows the performance to be reproduced even if the powertrain components are subjected to high loads. The result: outstanding dynamic handling and driving pleasure at all times.',
