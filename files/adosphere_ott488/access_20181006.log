The permanent all-wheel drive system features a two-stage transfer case, which is flange-mounted to the 7G-TRONIC PLUS main transmission. It is fitted with a central differential of planetary design, which distributes the drive force between the front and rear axle at a fixed torque distribution of 40 to 60 percent. Optimum traction is guaranteed by a continuously adjustable longitudinal differential in the transfer case, in the form of an electromechanical multiplate clutch. This ensures that the traction potential of all four wheels is fully realised on demanding terrain.\r\n\r\nThere are three different all-wheel drive modes: 4MAT for increased driving dynamics, 4H for improved traction off-road and 4L mode (low range). The latter has a selectable reduction gear of 1:2.9 as standard. The top speed in 4L mode is 80 km/h. In addition, a 100-percent differential lock is available for the rear axle, if desired. The combination of a controlled longitudinal differential lock (0-100 percent), rear-axle differential and reduction gear delivers good performance both on- and off-road.',

China is currently ranked as the largest market for all-electric vehicles, though countries like the US and Norway are also growing considerably, often triggered by government incentives such as subsidies and exemption from toll and parking fees. \r\n\r\nAccording to recent reports by ‘The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders’ (SMMT), many British drivers are still mistrustful or confused when it comes to pure electric cars. Research has shown that more than 52% of consumers are interested in purchasing electric cars, but hesitate due to concerns such finding a charging spot, or not feeling like they know enough about how an EV actually works. \r\n\r\nAs a result, Jaguar has teamed up with Presenter and Creator of Fully Charged Show Robert Llewelyn, to help customers realise the benefits and simplicity of actually owning an electric vehicle.

The highly capable and dynamic performance SUV features Jaguar Land Rover\'s first Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) powertrain and is capable of making trips of up to 31 miles (51km) with zero tailpipe emissions when driven in all-electric mode.\r\n\r\nThe new PHEV model, the P400e, is the most efficient Range Rover Sport and combines an advanced 300PS (221kW) four-cylinder Ingenium petrol engine with a 116PS (85kW) electric motor. This transformational technology is powered by an advanced 13.1kWh lithium-ion battery giving a total available power output of 404PS (297kW) from the permanent four-wheel drive (4WD) system.\r\n\r\nTogether they drive Land Rover\'s performance SUV from 0-100km/h in just 6.7 seconds and to a top speed of 137mph. With an impressive 640Nm of torque, the new powertrain mixes dynamic and sustainable performance with traditional Range Rover capability, comfort and refinement.\r\n\r\nThe P400e uses both the Ingenium petrol engine and electric motor to deliver CO2 emissions of 64g/km and fuel economy of up to 101mpg (2.8 l/100km) on the NEDC combined cycle, making this the most fuel-efficient Land Rover.
