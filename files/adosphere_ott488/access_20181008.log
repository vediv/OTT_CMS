The Mulsanne W.O.

Bentley’s personal 8 Litre car decades ago – the last model he designed for Bentley Motors back in 1930 – is displayed.\r\n\r\nAs Bentley approaches its centenary in 2019, Mulliner designers reflected on the last 99 years of an extraordinary British automotive story to imagine the new Mulsanne W.O. Edition. In doing so, they have created a truly unique collector’s item.\r\n\r\nThe Mulsanne W.O. Edition can be specified on any of the three-model Mulsanne range, based on customer preference. Key features include a colour split interior cut from Heritage Hide reflecting the patina of vintage cars, elegant Beluga black wheels, and a stunning cocktail cabinet or bottle cooler featuring a slice of W.O.’s own 8 Litre crankshaft set into the armrest.\r\n\r\nThis special model will make its public debut at Monterey Car Week in California USA in late August, with customer deliveries commencing in 2019 – Bentley’s centenary year.',

The heavily contoured powerdomes on the long bonnet allude to the powerful unit housed underneath it, while the broad wings make the dynamic potential of the AMG GT 4-Door Coupé distinctly visible. As with the two-door AMG GT models, a radiator blind, the so-called AIRPANEL, positioned in front of the central radiator air inlet improves the vehicle\'s aerodynamic efficiency according to requirements. The striking front splitter reduces lift on the front axle.\r\n\r\nCharacteristic Coupé architectural features include the frameless side windows and the flat windscreen which is drawn widely towards the rear. Even from the side perspective, the \"shark nose\" design looks especially dynamic and feisty. The tapered side line and the broad shoulders hint at the athletic and sporty orientation of the vehicle. Depending on the engine version, the heavily pronounced wheel housings are home to a broad range of 19 and 20-inch light-alloy wheels, not to mention optional 21-inch forged wheels, all of which provide a high degree of personalisation.',

The rugged Volvo V60 Cross Country is the latest addition to the company\'s line-up of brand new Volvos that underpins the company\'s transformation in recent years. Like its V60 sibling that was launched earlier this year on the driveway of a Stockholm villa, the Volvo V60 Cross Country personifies the versatile Swedish family estate. To that profile, it adds the capability on and off the beaten track that has defined Volvo\'s Cross Country range since its introduction in 1997, taking the V60 from the suburb to the skogen (Swedish for forest).',

The new Ford Transit Custom PHEV has been revealed promising 30 miles of zero emissions range, with a claimed total range north of 300 with use of an on-board generator – a 1.0-litre EcoBoost engine. The front wheels are driven by an electric motor, which gets its power from a 14kWh liquid-cooled lithium-ion battery pack, which in turn gets its energy from either the mains, or by running the 1.0-litre engine. The PHEV will offer the same 1-tonne payload and load volume of a standard diesel powered Transit Custom. A charge port has been built into the front bumper, allowing the Custom PHEV to be recharged in five hours using a domestic 240-volt 10-amp power supply. This drops to three hours using a commercial 240 volt 16-amp or 32-amp supply.',
