But unlike its predecessor, it goes even further in terms of winter performance, ensuring an excellent level of traction on snow.Many drivers are unable or unwilling to change tires in summer and winter; for both practical and budgetary reasons. It is true that some tire performance characteristics can improve as it wears, such as rolling resistance,but most degrade over time, and this is especially true of grip on wet or snowy ground. The MICHELIN CrossClimate + meets the needs of drivers by offering the best characteristics of a summer tire and a winter tire. On the one hand, it meets the requirements of drivers who are prefer  the safety of a summer tire (braking distance on dry or wet roads), on the other hand it offers mobility and safety during winter conditions, on wet ground or snowy roads. When new, the traction of the MICHELIN CrossClimate + on snow is the same level as the main \"all-season\" premium tires. When worn state, snow traction is equivalent to that of the same \"all-season\" premium tires, but when they are still at an intermediate wear level. From the first to the last kilometer, its performance therefore changes very little, when that of its premium competitors falls very significantly.In summer, the MICHELIN CrossClimate + also offers high-performance on dry roads , equivalent to a summer tire, where a winter tire’s performance degrades.',

The world’s most popular classic car exhibition is providing the meeting point for the international classic scene for the 30th time. From 21 to 25 March 2018, it offers the ideal frame to celebrate the landmark birthdays of some outstandingly fascinating models. At Essen, BMW Group Classic is looking back on the debut of the BMW M1 40 years ago. The mid-engined sports car with its timeless design and motor-sport history is one of the milestones in the company’s heritage. Ten years previously, the BMW 2800 CS had already ushered in the era of “large coupés”. These models were similarly the defining representative of their era both on the road and on the race track. BMW M1: Italian styling, Bavarian engine-building artistry. The common feature of the BMW M1 and the brand’s large coupés is their characteristic harmony combining aesthetics and sportiness. The body styling masterminded by Italian designer Giorgio Giugiaro gave the BMW M1 – only 1.14 metres in height – an Italian profile. The car’s inline six-cylinder engine was by contrast a masterpiece from Munich. Just like the vehicle concept, the drive technology was conceived to master the challenges on the race track and meet the requirements for being licensed as a road-going vehicle.',

The production vehicle used mechanical components from the contemporary Opel Kadett B and two-door hard top bodywork by French contractor Brissonneau & Lotz. The styling of the GT was often cited as similar to the 1968 Chevrolet Corvette which went on sale in September 1967. The Opel GT was equipped with a base 1.1 L OHV straight-4 engine, which produced 67 hp (SAE) at 6,000 rpm. However, most buyers chose an optional 1.9 L camshaft in head engine, which produced 102 hp (SAE) at 5200 to 5400 rpm. Some of the early 1968 models also came with a slightly higher compression \"H\" code cylinder head. In 1971, due to emissions regulations, Opel reduced the compression ratio of the 1.9 L engine used in the US and output fell to 83 hp (SAE). There was also a GT/J model, which was a less expensive version of the 1900-engined GT which was sold only in Europe. Standard transmission was a manual four-speed. A three-speed automatic was available with the 1.9 L engine. The model run of the Opel GT was from 1968 to 1973.',

It featured a smaller, lighter, 302-cubic-inch V-8 for improved weight balance, as well as quick-ratio steering and a heavy-duty suspension for track use. In keeping with its road-racing focus, the 1967 Camaro Z/28 was not available with an automatic transmission or air conditioning. While the new Camaro Z/28 is not intended to compete in a specific race series, it is solely focused on track capability. In initial testing, the Camaro Z/28 is three seconds faster per lap than the Camaro ZL1. That extra speed comes from three areas:\r\n\r\n    Increased grip: The Z/28 is capable of 1.05 g in cornering acceleration, due to comprehensive chassis revisions\r\n    Increased stopping power: the Z/28 features Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes capable of 1.5 g in deceleration, and consistent brake feel, lap after lap\r\n    Reduced curb weight: The naturally aspirated Z/28 weighs 300 pounds less than the supercharged Camaro ZL1, with changes ranging from lightweight wheels to thinner rear-window glass\r\n\r\nLike the original, the 2014 Chevrolet Camaro Z/28 is offered only with a manual transmission.
