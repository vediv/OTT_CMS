The Singleframe in octagon design and large side air inlets characterize the masculine front-end. Eight vertical bars divide up the radiator grille with its striking frame and reflect the SUV character. The headlights are narrow and run inwards with their wedge shape. Audi supplies them in three versions, all with LED technology. The top-of-the-line version are the Matrix LED headlights whose adaptive high beam intelligently illuminates the road.\r\n\r\nA highlight in the side view is the symmetrical lighting graphics of the headlights and rear lights. The shoulder line connects them from a styling perspective and provides an athletic overall impression with strong muscles over the wheel arches. The contours draw their inspiration from Audi\'s quattro DNA and make the SUV seem even wider; the color-contrasting wheel arch trims emphasize the offroad look. Supported by a long roof edge spoiler, which also flanks the rear window at the side, the steeply raked D pillars of the body line also create an appearance of forward thrust.',

The highly capable and dynamic performance SUV features Jaguar Land Rover\'s first Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) powertrain and is capable of making trips of up to 31 miles (51km) with zero tailpipe emissions when driven in all-electric mode.\r\n\r\nThe new PHEV model, the P400e, is the most efficient Range Rover Sport and combines an advanced 300PS (221kW) four-cylinder Ingenium petrol engine with a 116PS (85kW) electric motor. This transformational technology is powered by an advanced 13.1kWh lithium-ion battery giving a total available power output of 404PS (297kW) from the permanent four-wheel drive (4WD) system.\r\n\r\nTogether they drive Land Rover\'s performance SUV from 0-100km/h in just 6.7 seconds and to a top speed of 137mph. With an impressive 640Nm of torque, the new powertrain mixes dynamic and sustainable performance with traditional Range Rover capability, comfort and refinement.\r\n\r\nThe P400e uses both the Ingenium petrol engine and electric motor to deliver CO2 emissions of 64g/km and fuel economy of up to 101mpg (2.8 l/100km) on the NEDC combined cycle, making this the most fuel-efficient Land Rover.

Furthermore, the new model offers for the first time on a Fiat an all-new family of three- and four-cylinder engines which guarantee driving satisfaction and up to 20% better fuel efficiency than previous petrol engines, while being remarkably 20% quieter than their turbo diesel counterparts. The driving experience is as pleasant, comfortable and safe as ever with the new driving assist systems offered as standard equipment on all versions. The automatic traffic sign recognition system in connection with the Speed Advisor allows drivers to avoid breaking the speed limit by adapting, with a simple click, the car\'s speed using information it read from road signs along the way, while Lane Assist standard is a departure warning system for use on motorways.\r\n\r\nFor the launch of the New 500X, Fiat has made a delightful short movie lasting two and a half minutes, inspired by the cult film \"Back to the Future\", which consolidates the bond between the brand and the world of cinema, a relationship that culminated last year with the tribute video \"See you in the future\", created to celebrate the 500\'s 60th birthday of Fiat 500 and starring the Oscar-winner Adrien Brody. The new film is based on the concept of an exciting journey through time, in which a young couple start out in the Sixties on board a Fiat 600 of the period and are catapulted into the present at the wheel of the New 500X. The short movie ends with a special appearance by the American actor Christopher Lloyd, in the cameo role of a policeman giving a knowing wink, who ends the journey through time.',
