The newly-developed Smartstream 1.6-litre four-cylinder diesel engine reduces CO2 emissions and improves fuel efficiency, and comes with three different power outputs: 96 PS (70kW) available with a 6-speed manual transmission (6MT), 116 PS (85kW) available with 6MT or the 7-speed dual clutch transmission (7DCT), and 136 PS (100kW) with 6MT or 7DCT.\r\n\r\nAlong with the new Smartstream engine, the company equips the i30 five-door, i30 Wagon and i30 Fastback diesel variants with exhaust fluid after-treatment systems. The diesel exhaust fluid, a mix of urea and water, contributes to decreasing nitrogen oxide emissions. At the same time, all petrol engines of the i30 line-up have been equipped with a gasoline particulate filter.\r\n\r\nBesides the technological update, Hyundai has refreshed the exterior design of its i30 five-door and Wagon with a new front bumper. The front of both cars now features the charismatic i30 Fastback bumper. Its sleek and elegant lines enhance the progressive and timeless look of the i30 five-door and Wagon, harmonising the design of the i30 range. Additionally, Hyundai has updated the exterior colour range of the i30 five-door and Wagon to include Stellar Blue and Olivine Grey.',

Vision URBANETIC eliminates the separation between people moving and goods transport. It enables on-demand, sustainable and efficient movement of people and goods – and applies an innovative approach to fulfil the needs of cities, businesses from diverse sectors as well as city dwellers and travellers. The concept reduces traffic flows, relieves inner-city infrastructures and contributes to an improved quality of urban life.\r\nAs part of a holistic system solution, Vision URBANETIC addresses future urban challenges and offers innovative solutions. The visionary concept is based on a self-driving, electrically powered chassis that can take different switchable bodies for people moving or goods transport. As a ride-sharing vehicle, Vision URBANETIC can accommodate up to twelve passengers, while the cargo module can carry up to ten EPAL pallets. A load space 3.70 metres long fits into a total vehicle length of 5.14 metres. Plus, the concept incorporates an IT infrastructure that analyses in real time the supply and demand within a defined area. The result is a self-driving fleet, with routes planned flexibly and efficiently on the basis of current transportation needs. All of this makes Vision URBANETIC a groundbreaking concept for future urban mobility. Thanks to full networking, the evaluation of local information – such as concerts and events – and intelligent control, the system not only analyses current needs, it can also learn from them. It is thus able to anticipate and react to future needs. This can optimise processes and help shorten waiting and delivery times and avoid traffic jams. For instance, the overall system can use the data captured by the vehicle control centre – which collates and analyses needs – to identify a crowd of people gathering in a certain area. It can send vehicles there to quickly and efficiently satisfy the increased demand. The system can thus react flexibly and is not based on rigid routes or fixed timetables.',

The double-charged six-cylinder in-line engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology delivers 410 HP between 5,250 and 7,000 rpm. The engine\'s peak torque of 550 Nm is on tap between 2,350 and 5,200 rpm. The power unit boasts an insatiable appetite for revs for a turbocharged engine and offers exceptionally linear power delivery across a broad rev range. A dual exhaust system with electronic flap control provides the distinctive M sound, while the M TwinPower Turbo technology delivers outstanding efficiency. In relevant EU countries, the BMW M2 Competition also boasts an Otto particulate filter (OPF) to further reduce fine dust pollution.\r\n\r\nThe new BMW M2 Competition completes a standard sprint, from a standstill to 100 km/h, in 4.2 seconds (with M DCT, 4.4 seconds with six-speed manual gearbox). The top speed is electronically limited to 250 km/h. The car can be combined with the M Driver\'s Package to raise the top speed to 280 km/h - 10 km/h more than with the BMW M2 Coupé. The consumption figures are also noteworthy: with six-speed manual gearbox, the combined fuel consumption is 10,0 - 9,9 l/100 km, the combined CO2 emissions are 228 - 225 g/km. With the optional M Double Clutch Transmission (M DCT), these numbers decrease to only 9,2 l/100 km 210 - 209 CO2 emissions g/km combined.',

Vision URBANETIC eliminates the separation between people moving and goods transport. It enables on-demand, sustainable and efficient movement of people and goods – and applies an innovative approach to fulfil the needs of cities, businesses from diverse sectors as well as city dwellers and travellers. The concept reduces traffic flows, relieves inner-city infrastructures and contributes to an improved quality of urban life.\r\nAs part of a holistic system solution, Vision URBANETIC addresses future urban challenges and offers innovative solutions. The visionary concept is based on a self-driving, electrically powered chassis that can take different switchable bodies for people moving or goods transport. As a ride-sharing vehicle, Vision URBANETIC can accommodate up to twelve passengers, while the cargo module can carry up to ten EPAL pallets. A load space 3.70 metres long fits into a total vehicle length of 5.14 metres. Plus, the concept incorporates an IT infrastructure that analyses in real time the supply and demand within a defined area. The result is a self-driving fleet, with routes planned flexibly and efficiently on the basis of current transportation needs. All of this makes Vision URBANETIC a groundbreaking concept for future urban mobility. Thanks to full networking, the evaluation of local information – such as concerts and events – and intelligent control, the system not only analyses current needs, it can also learn from them. It is thus able to anticipate and react to future needs. This can optimise processes and help shorten waiting and delivery times and avoid traffic jams. For instance, the overall system can use the data captured by the vehicle control centre – which collates and analyses needs – to identify a crowd of people gathering in a certain area. It can send vehicles there to quickly and efficiently satisfy the increased demand. The system can thus react flexibly and is not based on rigid routes or fixed timetables.',
