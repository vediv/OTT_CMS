The new-generation model is only 1.41 meters (4.6 ft) in height - including aerial, the car is 1.43 meters (4.7 ft) tall. The wide track and short overhangs provide for a taut, sporty look. The wide, low-placed Singleframe grille and the implied side air inlets dominate the distinctive front. Below the edge of the hood are three flat slits - an homage to the Sport quattro, the brand\'s rally icon from 1984.\r\n\r\nThe new Audi A1 Sportback also emphasizes a resemblance to the Audi Ur-quattro and Sport quattro when viewed from the side: The wide, flat sloping C-pillar seems to push the car forward even while standing still. The roof contrast line, which is available in two dark colors, ends above the C-pillar. This gives the impression that the roof is flatter and the complete car is even lower-slung. All lines on the flanks, from the window edge to the sill, slope upward toward the rear in a wedge shape. The distinctively highlighted wheels and the low shoulder line in between give the A1 Sportback a solid stance on the road.

They keep the compact car at the right distance from the car ahead, making it easier for the driver to maintain the lane and help with parking.\r\n\r\nThe standard lane departure warning helps the driver to keep the car in the lane from a speed of 65 km/h (40.4 mph). Also standard is the speed limiter, which reliably prevents the Audi A1 Sportback from exceeding a selected maximum speed.\r\n\r\nAnother standard feature is Audi pre sense front. The radar sensor recognizes critical situations involving other vehicles, crossing pedestrians or cyclists ahead of the vehicle, even when visibility is poor such as in fog. The system then gives an acoustic and visual signal to warn the driver.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it prepares for a possible full brake application and, if necessary, initiates automatic emergency braking in order to prevent an imminent collision or reduce its impact. If necessary, the protective measures of the optional Audi pre sense basic are initiated. The front seat belts are electrically tensioned, the windows are closed and the hazard warning lights are switched on.\r\n\r\nThe adaptive speed assist is also radar-based. It keeps the Audi A1 Sportback at the desired distance from the vehicle ahead. If the vehicle is equipped with S tronic, the system covers a speed range of 0 to 200 km/h (124.3 mph); with the manual transmission, the range begins at 30 km/h (18.6 mph). In stop-and-go traffic, the A1 Sportback with S tronic transmission brakes to a standstill and gets going again under certain conditions automatically.\r\n\r\nThe new Audi A1 Sportback offers various systems to make parking easier. For the first time, there is a reversing camera in addition to the rear parking system. The front ultrasonic sensors of the system recognize objects in front of the car and emit acoustic and visual warnings. The park assist system steers the Audi A1 Sportback parallel and horizontally into parking spaces. With the new version of the assistant, the A1 Sportback also parks forward into perpendicular parking spaces, maneuvering multiple times if necessary. The system also exits parallel parking spaces.',

It’s 12 September 1963: Porsche proudly presents the eagerly anticipated successor to the 356. The new sports car, originally known as the 901, is following in great footsteps. To reflect the ambitions of the brand, Porsche is now playing in a higher league with the new model: a flat engine with six instead of four cylinders and air-cooled in the best traditions of the company, but delivering 130 PS straight away. When the new model came onto the market in 1964 it was called the 911 – the result of a discussion about naming rights with the automotive manufacturer Peugeot. The 911 is quickly accepted as a “genuine” Porsche because the performance of the new sports car exceeds all expectations. The stage is thus set for an unrivalled global career.',

The vehicle\'s proportions with a long wheelbase, short overhangs and large, flush-fitted wheels already leave no doubt that it feels at home and cuts a good figure on any terrain.\r\n\r\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLE follows the design strategy of sensual purity, and dispenses with individual edges and beading in favour of generously modelled surfaces. The surfaces interact with precise graphic elements.\r\n\r\nThe aesthetic appeal of the Mercedes-Benz GLE is based on the harmonious interaction between emotion and intelligence, which is designed to awaken desire. This is characterised by timeless beauty, a combination of high-grade technology and craftsmanship and reduction to what is really important.\r\n\r\nThe front section of the GLE exudes presence and power: this is ensured by the upright radiator grille in an octagonal SUV interpretation, the prominent, chrome-plated underguard and the bonnet with two powerdomes. This striking appearance is emphasised by the distinctive headlamp design by day and night.\r\n\r\nViewed from the side, the wide C-pillar typical of the GLE conveys self-assured stability. The striking, dark wheel arch claddings and the new, larger wheels in sizes 18 to 22 inches clearly emphasise the SUV character of the vehicle, and ensure a powerful presence. The pillared roof rails or the optional illuminated running boards likewise confirm the robust SUV character of the vehicle. The chrome surrounds of the windows are however reminiscent of a premium saloon model.\r\n\r\nThe sporty and athletic appearance of the GLE is continued into the rear end. This is particularly ensured by the powerful shoulder muscle extending from the C-pillar to the rear lights. The reflectors are relocated lower down, giving the rear lights a flatter appearance. They are also in two sections. This not only gives an impression of width, but also creates an unmistakable night design with illuminated blocks typical of Mercedes-Benz SUVs, in this case with backlit edge lighting. The rear is strikingly rounded off with the chrome-plated underguard.',
