GTI is here. The concept and power output of the 85 kW / 115 PS up! GTI are broadly in line with the Volkswagen Golf GTI Mk1 unveiled in 1976 with 81 kW / 110 PS. As a compact bundle of power, the new up! GTI pays tribute to this icon - with crisp dimensions, low weight, a powerful and fuel-efficient engine (WLTP consumption: combined 5.7 to 5.6 l/100 km), greater downforce on the rear axle, sports running gear and the typical insignia of a GTI (including red stripes in the radiator grille, red brake callipers and \"clark\" tartan seat covers). The 196 km/h sports car brings a new dimension in driving fun to the small car class, thus creating a clear link back to the original compact Golf GTI. One typical GTI element is the finely tuned sports running gear. It gives the car the agility of a go-kart, while simultaneously providing a high level of comfort. The GTI is in addition the first up! to come with a petrol particulate filter. With this catalytic converter system the Volkswagen up! GTI fulfils the new European Euro AG emissions standard. However, the most powerful of all up! models remains affordable. As was the case with the Golf GTI Mk1, so too with the new up! GTI: high performance does not mean high prices. In Germany, home of the inventor of the GTI, the product line\'s top model is available, for example, for €16,975 - including sports running gear (15 mm lower body), air conditioning, ambient lighting, redesigned 17-inch (\"Brands Hatch\") alloy wheels and infotainment system.',

To facilitate this, the students invited SKODA customers and fans to submit suggestions via different social media channels. In the end, Sunroq was chosen from among several hundred proposed names – the students found that it suited their cabriolet perfectly given its openness to the sun, which makes it an ideal vehicle for a summer holiday. The author of the winning submission was invited to the SUNROQ’s official presentation. He will meet with the students and their teachers and will be even able to go on a drive in the functional concept car, which has a Velvet Red paint finish.',

In the pack of memories, even if limited to the Formula One years, you can draw randomly and find something: from the first victory with Alberto Ascari, dated 1951, to the world confirmation of Lauda and Scheckter to the five successes of Michael Schumacher - all with the Red, in the space of eleven years - which in the history of F1 remains the most seen rider on the highest step of the Monza podium. That podium that today has become a catwalk able to offer a unique view, both to those above and to the public below.\r\n\r\nThe national Grand Prix number 69 (only one, remember, was not held in Monza but in Imola in the 80) started practically close to that of Belgium. A small team was seconded for the preparation of the Milan event on Wednesday 29, the activity at the Autodromo began in the early days of the week. Spa and Monza chase each other on the calendar and, in the collective imagination, they also look like super-fast tracks. In reality there are several differences, because the route of Brianza does not have the full bends from that of the Ardennes but, on the contrary, asks a lot more to the brakes and promises, in a straight line, even greater speeds. If there is a common point, besides being two classics of the calendar, it is the passion of the fans that never fails. And that in Monza, not even to say it, is above all red passion.',

The Saloon, Estate, Coupé and Cabriolet (combined fuel consumption: 10.4-9.9 l/100 km; combined CO2 emissions: 236-227 g/km)[1] now feature a sharper exterior, a modernised interior and even more agility. The fast-shifting AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 9G transmission, the electronically controlled rear-axle differential, and the nine-stage AMG TRACTION CONTROL (in the C 63 S) take longitudinal and lateral dynamics to a new level. AMG DYNAMICS enhances driving pleasure, too: this built-in dynamic handling control extends the functions of the ESP, allowing precisely measured torque distribution on the rear axle (Torque Vectoring), which increases agility while maintaining a high level of stability. The new C 63 has a more emotive look, too: the AMG-specific radiator trim underscores the brand identity while emphasising the muscular appearance. The interior benefits from an optional fully digital cockpit with unmistakable AMG displays and the new generation of AMG steering wheels.\r\n\r\nThe C 63 is the bedrock of Mercedes-AMG. Drivers and fans love it because it is one of a kind in its segment. Its signature feature is the immensely powerful eight-cylinder engine ‑ no other model in the competitive environment can pick from such an embarrassment of riches. The V8 is an unshakeable part of the AMG brand identity. The rear-wheel drive, the AMG-specific suspension and the athletic overall appearance likewise set the C 63 apart from its competitors. It also offers a wealth of individualisation options, including four body versions, two output variants and an extensive range of optional extras.',
