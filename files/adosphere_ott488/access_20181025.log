The ambience that the brand aims to exude is initially characterised in terms of colour. A glowing, pulsating red, positioned to accentuate it against a dark backdrop, symbolises power, passion and performance. The materials used are distinguished by their authenticity and very consciously establish a link to the high-technology world of motor racing. The use of contrasts, too, such as smooth – rough, soft – hard, shiny – matt, serves to emphasise the performance aspirations of AMG. New highlights are set by the use of more refined materials revealing, for example, a marble-like structure, thereby conveying a powerful interpretation of the concept of luxury. Dynamic graphics, shapes and their proportions create a sense of speed and underscore the muscular beauty of the brand aesthetic.',

From there, the Lamborghinis challenged the mythical Trollstigen, commonly known as the road of the Trolls, legendary creatures of Norwegian folklore with grotesque human features. A masterpiece of road engineering, the Trollstigen was completed in 1936 following eight years of work, and winds along eleven hairpin turns that climb dizzily up a vertical wall of rock and waterfalls. \r\n\r\nThe Lamborghini group continued through Valldal, the valley of strawberries, and on to Geirangerfjord, designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO and featured on every list of the most spectacular places in the world. The adventure continued across the Jostedalsbreen, the largest glacier in Europe, and the convoy of super sports cars demonstrated the utmost reliability even on a dirt road with a lunar landscape. After a rest stop in the quiet village of Loen, situated at the end of an arm of the Nordfjord, and ferryboat transfers, the group finally arrived at Mount Aksla, which overlooks the fairy-tale town of Ålesund.',

It means a smooth and refined feeling on the road, with precise and stress-free steering and handling. It\'s measured and benchmarked in three scenarios - on motorways, on country roads and in the urban environment.\r\n\r\nThe Nissan Qashqai has always been renowned for its confident drive. However, there have been numerous upgrades to the new Qashqai\'s performance on the road. While they represent some of the most significant enhancements to the car, they are not all immediately visible to the customer. However, the results can be easily perceived, leading to even greater feelings of customer safety and trust.\r\n\r\nThe development team at Nissan Technical Centre Europe used insight from existing Qashqai owners and their own research. It led them to focus on upgrades to the Qashqai\'s ride, handling and steering to improve it even further.\r\n\r\nOn ride comfort, the priority was calmer body motion and improved impact shock. This was achieved by retuning the dampers, reducing the single wheel spring rate, and modifying rubber components. The anti-roll bar stiffness has been increased to maintain handling performance. There is now reduced body motion when going over large bumps thanks to changes to the car\'s Active Ride Control system.\r\n\r\nTo enhance handling, the engineering team has created a more secure feel and improved line traceability through corners. This has been achieved with a new thicker steering shaft and changes to the steering effort build-up around dead centre.\r\n\r\nOn steering, a new technology called Active Return Control means the steering wheel now returns to centre more naturally, with improved precision during driving. The assembly behind the new steering wheel features a new dynamic damper which has resulted in less vibration reaching the driver\'s hands.',

China is currently ranked as the largest market for all-electric vehicles, though countries like the US and Norway are also growing considerably, often triggered by government incentives such as subsidies and exemption from toll and parking fees. \r\n\r\nAccording to recent reports by ‘The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders’ (SMMT), many British drivers are still mistrustful or confused when it comes to pure electric cars. Research has shown that more than 52% of consumers are interested in purchasing electric cars, but hesitate due to concerns such finding a charging spot, or not feeling like they know enough about how an EV actually works. \r\n\r\nAs a result, Jaguar has teamed up with Presenter and Creator of Fully Charged Show Robert Llewelyn, to help customers realise the benefits and simplicity of actually owning an electric vehicle.

It was 1968 when the House of Sant’Agata Bolognese presented its first four-seater (Espada) and the evolution of its 2+2 (Islero).\r\nThe tour route covered almost 800 km, crossing through Umbria, Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna. Some twenty colorful Lamborghinis cruised over picturesque hill routes and through the historic centers of cities full of charm and history such as Perugia, Orvieto and Assisi. Though every one of the cars was worthy of the utmost attention, there were some that stood out for their particular story or that of the owner, deserving a special mention at the end of the tour by Stefano Domenicali, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Lamborghini.An award for the car owned the longest by a single owner went to the 1973 Espada Series 3, chassis 9300, purchased as a used car in January 1977 by two English owners. For years it was the only family car, used on a daily basis to go to work and take the children to school. Considered by its owners to be part of the family, it was recently restored and registered for the tour on the occasion of the owners’ golden wedding anniversary.',

One of the special features is a basic volume, which drops away towards the occupants and has cutouts in the area of the driver and front passenger. The intuitive user interface of the adaptive MBUX multimedia system is ground-breaking. Its strengths include brilliant graphics, “Hey Mercedes” voice control, a standard touch screen and functions such as MBUX Augmented Reality. When it comes to active safety, state-of-the-art driving assistance systems make the B-Class one of the segment leaders with functions carried over from the S-Class. In addition, the interior is now more spacious, while the engines are more efficient and cleaner. The eight-speed dual-clutch transmission makes its debut.

It picks up on the striking proportions, the convex surfaces and the muscular body of the two-door variant and further develops these into the characteristic shape of the four-door version. The flowing silhouette with low greenhouse and dynamic fastback underscores the sporty focus.\r\n\r\nThe front end is markedly dynamic with its broad, low-drawn \"shark nose\", filigree MULTIBEAM LED headlamps with carbon-fibre elements, AMG-specific radiator trim and front apron featuring further-developed jet wing (with flowing A wing in the case of six-cylinder models). The heavily contoured powerdomes on the long bonnet allude to the powerful unit housed underneath it, while the broad wings make the dynamic potential of the AMG GT 4-Door Coupé distinctly visible. As with the two-door AMG GT models, a radiator blind, the so-called AIRPANEL, positioned in front of the central radiator air inlet improves the vehicle\'s aerodynamic efficiency according to requirements. The striking front splitter reduces lift on the front axle.\r\n\r\nCharacteristic Coupé architectural features include the frameless side windows and the flat windscreen which is drawn widely towards the rear. Even from the side perspective, the \"shark nose\" design looks especially dynamic and feisty. The tapered side line and the broad shoulders hint at the athletic and sporty orientation of the vehicle. Depending on the engine version, the heavily pronounced wheel housings are home to a broad range of 19 and 20-inch light-alloy wheels, not to mention optional 21-inch forged wheels, all of which provide a high degree of personalisation.',
