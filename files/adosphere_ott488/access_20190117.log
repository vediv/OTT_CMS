Quiet, with impressive pulling power, this improved version features a longer operating range. Here\'s a forward thinking way to promote an ethical and responsible urban approach to business. The e-NV200 shares a base vehicle platform with the Nissan Micra, which should give you an idea of quite how compact this van is. The 1.5-litre diesel engine is ditched in this instance for an 80kW AC synchronous motor, which is fully integrated with the battery charger and inverter in one compact, self-contained unit. There\'s MacPherson strut front suspension and a torsion beam rear, and the Lithium-ion battery has been designed to fit under the cargo floor without impinging on available space. This battery pack is now 40kW in size and packaged very efficiently. This battery assembly also helps boost the torsional and lateral stiffness of the vehicle by 20 percent and 35 percent respectively over an ordinary NV200 and helps reduce the centre of gravity. This also aids ride and handling, while the instant torque delivery is perfect for stop and start city driving. It\'s quicker than the diesel van to 62mph too, eventually running out of amps at 75mph. ',

Full production will begin in 2020. Right now, at the international \'Auto Shanghai 2017\', the German carmaker is providing an important look ahead at this new family of electric mobility vehicles. The I.D. CROZZ is Volkswagen\'s first electrically powered crossover utility vehicle (CUV) - a four-door coupé and sports utility vehicle (SUV) in one. Following the headline-grabbing presentations of the I.D. (world premiere in Paris in 2016) and I.D. BUZZ (world premiere in Detroit in 2017), the I.D. CROZZ now follows as the third exciting version of the I.D. family. It is, once again, a zero-emissions vehicle with a very long range, charismatic electric mobility design and an interior concept that is completely new. The sportily designed I.D. CROZZ now underlines, as a concrete example of what might be seen in 2020, just how diverse the electrifying spectrum of future Volkswagen electric models is going to be.',
