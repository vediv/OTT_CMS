Vision URBANETIC eliminates the separation between people moving and goods transport. It enables on-demand, sustainable and efficient movement of people and goods – and applies an innovative approach to fulfil the needs of cities, businesses from diverse sectors as well as city dwellers and travellers. The concept reduces traffic flows, relieves inner-city infrastructures and contributes to an improved quality of urban life.\r\nAs part of a holistic system solution, Vision URBANETIC addresses future urban challenges and offers innovative solutions. The visionary concept is based on a self-driving, electrically powered chassis that can take different switchable bodies for people moving or goods transport. As a ride-sharing vehicle, Vision URBANETIC can accommodate up to twelve passengers, while the cargo module can carry up to ten EPAL pallets. A load space 3.70 metres long fits into a total vehicle length of 5.14 metres. Plus, the concept incorporates an IT infrastructure that analyses in real time the supply and demand within a defined area. The result is a self-driving fleet, with routes planned flexibly and efficiently on the basis of current transportation needs. All of this makes Vision URBANETIC a groundbreaking concept for future urban mobility. Thanks to full networking, the evaluation of local information – such as concerts and events – and intelligent control, the system not only analyses current needs, it can also learn from them. It is thus able to anticipate and react to future needs. This can optimise processes and help shorten waiting and delivery times and avoid traffic jams. For instance, the overall system can use the data captured by the vehicle control centre – which collates and analyses needs – to identify a crowd of people gathering in a certain area.

Today we can choose from an extensive range of goods worldwide that are delivered right to our doors. This would not be possible without freight transport and logistics.

They are also service providers and chauffeurs. They dispose of our waste, help us to move house, assist the rescue services, take our children to school and drive us to work. So commercial vehicles actually keep our everyday lives “on the go.”The 67th IAA Commercial Vehicles in Hannover from September 20 to 27, 2018, will address the question of what the future of commercial vehicles will be like. And in fact the whole commercial vehicle sector is on a path of innovation. As in many other branches of industry, the particularly important topics here are automation and connectivity, safety and security, environmental protection, electric mobility and new logistics and traffic concepts for the towns of the future.The IAA Commercial Vehicles takes place in Hannover every two years, and is the world’s leading trade show for transport, logistics and mobility.
