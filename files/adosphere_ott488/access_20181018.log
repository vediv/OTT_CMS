New developments from Bosch could enable vehicle manufacturers to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) so drastically that they already comply with future limits. Even in RDE (real driving emissions) testing, emissions from vehicles equipped with the newly premièred Bosch diesel technology are not only significantly below current limits but also those scheduled to come into force from 2020. Bosch engineers achieved these results by refining existing technologies. There is no need for additional components, which would drive up costs. ',

Whether smart assistance systems or connectivity packages, Bosch offers many solutions that make roads safer for motorcyclists. And with its innovative research projects, it is already planning for the next stages of development.\r\n\r\nSliding mitigation research project:\r\n\r\nWhether wet leaves, an oil spill, or gravel on the road surface, wheels begin to slip sideways if they can no longer apply sufficient lateral force in a curve. In situations such as these, motorcyclists have practically no chance of righting their bikes. Ideally, keeping them safely on course would require applying additional external lateral force. This is the idea behind the sliding mitigation Bosch is developing in a research project. Like a magic hand, it keeps the motorcycle on track and considerably reduces the risk of a fall. A sensor detects sideways wheel slip. If a certain value is exceeded, gas is released from a gas accumulator of the type used in passenger-car airbags. The gas flows into the tank adapter and is vented in a certain direction through a nozzle. This reverse thrust keeps the motorcycle on track.\r\n\r\nRadar-based assistance systems:\r\n\r\nGiving motorcycles radar as a sensory organ enables these new motorcycle assistance and safety functions while providing an accurate picture of the vehicle’s surroundings. As a result, these assistance functions not only increase safety, they also enhance enjoyment and convenience by making life easier for riders.',

That means it features the same active and passive safety technologies, as well as the semi-autonomous Pilot Assist system and the touchscreen-focused Sensus infotainment introduced with the XC90. As far as the exterior design goes compared to the also SPA-based V90 and V90 Cross Country, this time around, Volvo could play around a bit more with the light, both in order to break up the mass visually, and to give the 60 models a more dominant stance. This tightened look is a requirement in this segment, not to mention that the V60 is also destined to spawn a Polestar variant sometime in the future. Still, if you ever saw a V90 with the R-Design package in the wild, the V60 won\'t cause a heart attack. While other markets get two diesel options until the world gives up on them for good, Volvo\'s American offering starts with the front-wheel drive T5 (specs to be confirmed) and the all-wheel drive T6. This car packs 310 horsepower and 295 ft.-lbs. of torque, giving it a zero-to-sixty time of 5.8 seconds. Both plug-in hybrids are a full second quicker off the line, with the T6 Twin Engine having a peak output of 340 (253 gas+87 electric) horses and 435 ft.-lbs. of torque.
