The “Circuit Park” there is an iconic track in the dunes – demanding and fast in equal measure. BMW drivers have brought home a total of four wins there since 2012 and are eager to end the first half of the 2018 season with a strong performance. BMW Team RMG’s Marco Wittmann (GER) is currently the best-placed BMW driver in the overall standings. With 92 points to his name, he is in third place. His team-mate Timo Glock (GER) has clocked up the same number of points, but is in fourth place due to a lower number of wins (Wittmann two wins, Glock one win). Wittmann in particular is full of confidence heading to the North Sea coast. He recently finished on the podium three times in a row, which saw him consistently make up ground on the leaders in the driver’s standings.',
