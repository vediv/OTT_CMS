In Europe, more than 400,000 units of Hyundai Santa Fe have been sold over the past 17 years - and the fourth generation Santa Fe is expected to attract more customers with its premium design, more space and advanced technology. It is the flagship model of the longstanding SUV heritage that Hyundai has built up. It also provides one of the best-in-class safety packages, remarkable roominess and innovative comfort features that enhance the customer\'s daily life.\r\n\r\nThe design of the fourth generation Hyundai Santa Fe connects with Hyundai\'s new SUV family look. It displays a modern and prestigious appearance complemented by the eye-catching Composite Light and the Cascading Grille, Hyundai\'s family identity. The exterior design is characterised by a powerful wide stance and an athletic, bold look. Its refined lines reinforce the car\'s status at the top of Hyundai\'s SUV line-up.\r\n\r\nThe All-New Santa Fe features an advanced four-wheel drive system with an enhanced torque application depending on wheel grip and the speed of vehicle, called HTRAC. Hyundai\'s next generation four-wheel drive technology controls the torque distribution and braking power of the front and rear wheels variably. It supports drivers in all kinds of driving situations, whether on snow, slippery roads or in regular road conditions, and enhances stability in cornering.',
