Shortly before the IAA Commercial Vehicles Show, which is to be held in Hannover from September 20 to 27, 2018, Mercedes-Benz Trucks presented the brand’s new flagship to the world press on Wednesday evening. The new Actros increases safety for all road users, efficiency for operators and comfort for drivers to unprecedented levels.\r\n\r\nThe most important and most spectacular innovation is Active Drive Assist, with which Mercedes-Benz Trucks puts partially automated driving into series production. The new Active Drive Assist can brake, accelerate and steer independently. Unlike systems that only work at certain speeds, Active Drive Assist offers the driver partially automated driving in all speed ranges for the first time in a series-produced truck. New elements are the active latitudinal control and the combination of longitudinal and lateral control in all speed ranges through the fusion of radar and camera information.\r\n\r\nActive Drive Assist builds upon the tried-and-tested adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go function and the lane-keeping assistant from Mercedes-Benz. While responsibility for monitoring the traffic situation remains with the driver, the system provides significant support and makes an important contribution to increased road safety.',
