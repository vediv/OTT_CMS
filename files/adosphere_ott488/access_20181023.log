Engineers at the SEAT Technical Centre perform several tests long before manufacturing begins on vehicles. The following are the five most strenuous tests that are carried out in the three year development period of each car seat:\r\n\r\n-Getting in and out 700 times a day: A diverse group of men and women of all sizes and builds are the team of professional testers that reproduce the action of getting in and out of a car 6,000 times in a week. “Each tester repeats this action 700 times a day to simulate what a car seat endures over a period of five years”, explains Javier García, the engineer in charge of SEAT’s car seat testing. “Some of them wear jeans with rivets and buttons on the back pockets or reinforced seams”, in order to ensure the resistance of the foam and fabric of the future car seat, which in addition has to adapt to any driver who sits on it.\r\n\r\n-Rub resistant: Another test consists in reproducing multiple rubbing motions on a car seat. It is carried out in the lab and simulates the weight of a 75 kg torso. “For 3 weeks, a machine performs 22,000 friction cycles 24 hours a day, simulating daily movements made by a user weighing more than 100 kg”, says Javier. Following the test it is essential to assess the performance of the car seat and verify whether it still looks the same and has the same initial properties.',

Furthermore, the new model offers for the first time on a Fiat an all-new family of three- and four-cylinder engines which guarantee driving satisfaction and up to 20% better fuel efficiency than previous petrol engines, while being remarkably 20% quieter than their turbo diesel counterparts. The driving experience is as pleasant, comfortable and safe as ever with the new driving assist systems offered as standard equipment on all versions. The automatic traffic sign recognition system in connection with the Speed Advisor allows drivers to avoid breaking the speed limit by adapting, with a simple click, the car\'s speed using information it read from road signs along the way, while Lane Assist standard is a departure warning system for use on motorways.\r\n\r\nFor the launch of the New 500X, Fiat has made a delightful short movie lasting two and a half minutes, inspired by the cult film \"Back to the Future\", which consolidates the bond between the brand and the world of cinema, a relationship that culminated last year with the tribute video \"See you in the future\", created to celebrate the 500\'s 60th birthday of Fiat 500 and starring the Oscar-winner Adrien Brody. The new film is based on the concept of an exciting journey through time, in which a young couple start out in the Sixties on board a Fiat 600 of the period and are catapulted into the present at the wheel of the New 500X. The short movie ends with a special appearance by the American actor Christopher Lloyd, in the cameo role of a policeman giving a knowing wink, who ends the journey through time.',

They are aimed particularly at drivers who love design and appreciate a vehicle that is ideally suited for everyday use but do not want to sacrifice sportiness. In addition to a number of performance-orientated features, the GTS models boast a high trim level, even in the basic package. Sporty contrasts and exceptional details give them that added extra.\r\n\r\nThe 904 Carrera GTS first brought motorsport technology to the streets as a road-approved sports car back in 1963. The 924 GTS and 928 GTS that followed refined this principle throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 2010, the GTS celebrated its rebirth in the form of the 911 Carrera GTS (Type 997), followed in 2014 by the Porsche Boxster GTS and Cayman GTS.\r\n\r\nThe beating heart of every Porsche sports car has always been the flat engine. The mid-engine 718 GTS is powered by a 2.5-litre, four-cylinder turbo flat engine with 269 kW (365 hp). The maximum torque of 430 Nm in conjunction with PDK is achieved between 1,900 and 5,000 rpm. As a result, it is available much earlier than in the previous GTS with a six-cylinder flat engine. In combination with the six-speed manual transmission, a maximum torque of 420 Nm is available between 1,900 and 5,500 rpm. With these improvements, the turbo engine delivers 11 kW (15 hp) more power than the 718 S models and up to 26 kW (35 hp) more power than its GTS predecessor with naturally aspirated engine.',

The diamond grille with chrome pins, brilliant black optics and AMG lettering are other features of the AMG 43 models.\r\nThe side view is dominated by AMG light alloy five-spoke 19-inch high gloss wheels painted in glossy black. The rear end also features distinctive highlights, with two four-flow chrome exhaust outlets that convey a particularly sporty aesthetic. The rear apron trim in diffuser look is silver chrome, while the standard spoiler lip on the trunk lid is painted in the body color.\r\nThe interior reinforces the dynamic caliber of the new E 43 4MATIC with many individual details. The driver and front passenger find a secure position in sports seats even in fast driving, thanks to improved side support. The artificial leather upholstery ARTICO / microfiber DINAMICA in black (optional: Nappa leather) has a particular layout and red stitching. To match the seat design, the center door panels and dashboard are finished in ARTICO artificial leather with red stitching. Exclusive pedals, a black roof lining and red safety belts add other sporting highlights.\r\nThe multifunction sport steering wheel in black nappa leather with contrasting red stitching and the flattened lower part is perfect for an emphatic style of driving. The AMG instrument cluster provides all relevant information in a clear and optimized layout for a dynamic driving style.

That makes it the most powerful five-cylinder engine on the world market. Its 480 Nm (354.0 lb-ft) of torque is available at engine speeds between 1,700 and 5,850 revolutions per minute for outstanding tractive power. The compact RS model sprints from 0 to 100 km/h (62.1 mph) in just 4.1 seconds. It can attain a maximum speed of 250 km/h (155.3 mph); on request Audi will increase the electronically limited top speed to 280 km/h (174.0 mph). The unique sound of the five-cylinder unit intensifies an already emotionally charged driving experience. Its sound comes from having the ignition alternate between directly adjacent cylinders and widely spaced ones. The sound can be modified via Audi drive select.\r\n\r\nWith its light-alloy crankcase, the five-cylinder engine is 26 kilograms (57.3 lb) lighter than its predecessor. It employs a dual injection into the intake manifold and into the combustion chambers, as well as the Audi valvelift system for variable control of the exhaust valves.

The all-digital MMI touch response system provides intuitive operation and even more personalization. The extensive connectivity and assistance systems demonstrate intelligent automotive connectivity. The suspension combines smooth ride comfort and unshakable stability with enhanced sportiness. All engines use an efficient mild hybrid system.\r\n\r\nTo further enhance comfort and efficiency, all available engines in the new A6 are fitted with a mild hybrid system. This signifies that, after the A8 and the A7, Audi has now fully electrified a third model line. A belt alternator starter (BAS) works together with a lithium-ion battery with 10 Ah capacity. In combination with the six-cylinder engines, a 48V mild hybrid system is used. The A6 can coast between 55 and 160 km/h (34.2 and 99.4 mph) and the start-stop kicks in right from 22 km/h (13.7 mph). During deceleration, the BAS recovers up to 12 kW of energy. In real-world driving, the mild hybrid technology based on 48V reduces fuel consumption by up to 0.7 liters per 100 kilometers.\r\n\r\nLong journeys are the domain of the new Audi A6. With a generous amount of space, many convenience features and minimal interior noise, the business-class sedan pampers driver and passengers alike. Its interior is even larger than on the outgoing model – the A6 beats the core competitors in important criteria such as legroom in the rear.\r\n\r\nThe A6 is perfectly equipped for long journeys with new convenience functions. The seats are all-new. The top-of-the-line options include the customized contour front seats with numerous adjustment functions, optionally fitted with ventilation and massage function. The optional air quality package provides a subtle fragrance and improves the air with an ionizer. The optional panoramic glass sunroof floods the interior with light. The luggage compartment, with its capacity of 530 liters will accommodate two golf bags crosswise, while the trunk lid can be closed electrically with a kicking motion as an option.\r\n\r\nOn the sleek instrument panel of the new A6, a technical, futuristic black-panel design dominates which impressively combines form and function. The design language appears reduced and matter-of-fact; the horizontal lines create an airy sense of space. The center console and the two MMI touch response displays are angled slightly toward the driver. When switched off, the top display is incorporated almost invisibly into the dark decorative surface.\r\n\r\nThe wide range of colors and materials which Audi provides for the new A6 lend the interior design very different characteristics – from elegant through contemporary to sporty. Five interior trim lines are available with different color concepts: basic, sport, design, design selection and the S line sport package with 19-inch wheels and sport suspension. All elements, from the open-pore wood trim to the upholstery in Valcona leather, attest to the uncompromisingly high Audi quality. The S line exterior package is available as an option for all trim lines.\r\n',

It would soon become a global phenomenon with over two million cars made. The Fiat 500 is sold in over 100 countries worldwide and over 80% of sales are outside of Italy. Since 2013, the Fiat 500 is number one in Europe with a share of 14.6% at end of 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, it was the confirmed market leader in nine countries (UK, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Portugal, Austria, Hungary, Croatia and Slovenia) and ranked in the top three in seven others (Italy, Germany, France, Sweden, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria). In the first quarter of 2018, in its eleventh year, the 500 broke its own records with nearly 60,000 cars sold in Europe. One of the secrets of the uninterrupted worldwide success of the Fiat 500 is its continual development, as demonstrated by the 30 special editions Fiat and Abarth models, which have been launched over the past 11 years. The Fiat 500 has always been a trendsetter that while remaining true to itself has been re-interpreting its unique identity and working with brands to create an array of unique special series, from fashion and luxury yachts to art and sports. The new 500 Collezione special series is the tribute to the iconic Fiat and follows in the steps of the limited edition 500-60th and the Anniversario models released last year to celebrate its sixty anniversary. Stylish, fashionable and full of the latest technology, the new 500 Collezione is ready for the Spring Summer season. References to the classic forerunner are clearly visible on the special edition, with chrome-plated accents on the bumper, bonnet and mirrors, which perfectly complement the elegant two-tone livery and the chrome-plated cursive \"Collezione\" badge on the boot. The same understated elegance and timeless style elements are found inside, together with the best in connectivity and comfort. ',

It means a smooth and refined feeling on the road, with precise and stress-free steering and handling. It\'s measured and benchmarked in three scenarios - on motorways, on country roads and in the urban environment.\r\n\r\nThe Nissan Qashqai has always been renowned for its confident drive. However, there have been numerous upgrades to the new Qashqai\'s performance on the road. While they represent some of the most significant enhancements to the car, they are not all immediately visible to the customer. However, the results can be easily perceived, leading to even greater feelings of customer safety and trust.\r\n\r\nThe development team at Nissan Technical Centre Europe used insight from existing Qashqai owners and their own research. It led them to focus on upgrades to the Qashqai\'s ride, handling and steering to improve it even further.',

They have resulted in the highest levels of perceived quality and refinement, a more driver-oriented interior and an enhanced feeling of total control.\r\n\r\nEntering the car, the striking new steering wheel is the first thing drivers will notice. It echoes the design of Nissan\'s newest models globally, including the all-new Micra and the new X-Trail, and is standard across the Qashqai range. Now D-shaped, the horizontal base means easier entry and exit for the driver, as well as providing a more sporty look and feel.\r\n\r\nThe steering wheel\'s compact central hub is smaller than before and the three spokes are slimmer, creating an upper space that\'s larger by 17% to improve instrument visibility. The four-way controllers for the combimeter display (left spoke) and cruise control (right spoke) are new, and offer customers more intuitive use and reduced \'eyes off the road\' time.\r\n\r\nThe rim\'s width has been widened - from 34mm to 37.5mm - to provide a more comfortable and safer grip. A new premium style comes from the satin silver detailing on the central spoke, which echoes the shape of Nissan\'s iconic \'V-motion\' front grille.\r\n',
