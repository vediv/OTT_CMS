With the latest update, the off-road icon - which has been continually enhanced technically over the decades but visually has hardly changed - is making the leap into a new era - both in terms of technology and form. The new G-Class is 53 mm longer and 121 mm wider and now has even greater presence, on the road as well as in terrain.\r\n\r\nMore than ever, the new G-Class appears to be cast from a single piece. All surfaces have a more taut design and are have more tension, while the surface quality has been taken to an even higher level. This results in narrower, more precise gaps and more harmonious transitions. In addition, the wheel arches and bumpers form a more integral part of the body and thus look less like add-on features.',
