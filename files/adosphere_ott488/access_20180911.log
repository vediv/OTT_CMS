In mid-2019 the time has now come: The EQC is the first Mercedes-Benz vehicle to be launched under the EQ brand. With its seamless, clear design and colour highlights typical of the brand, it is a pioneer for an avant-garde electric look while representing the design idiom of Progressive Luxury. With respect to quality, safety and comfort the EQC is the Mercedes-Benz among electric vehicles, and highly convincing in the sum of its attributes. These are accompanied by dynamic performance, thanks to two electric motors at the front and rear axles with a combined output of 300 kW. A sophisticated operating strategy enables an electric range of more than 450 km according to NEDC. EQ also offers comprehensive services with Mercedes me, and makes electromobility convenient and suitable for day-to-day motoring. The Mercedes-Benz EQC also symbolises the start of a new mobility era at Daimler.\r\n\r\nAs the first Mercedes-Benz model under the new product and technology brand EQ, the Mercedes-Benz EQC has many trailblazing design details and colour highlights typical of the brand. Both inside and out, the EQC embodies the design idiom of Progressive Luxury. This arises from the combination of a previously unknown beauty, the conscious clash of digital and analogue elements as well as the seamless merging of intuitive and physical design.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of its muscular proportions, the Mercedes-Benz EQC is classed as a crossover SUV. The extended roofline and window layout with a low waistline and the coupé-like roof recess at the rear visually position it between an SUV and an SUV coupé.',

Standard on all AWD trims, i-VTM4 uses an electronically-controlled, hydraulically-actuated rear differential to apportion engine torque between the front and rear axles, and dynamically distribute torque between the left and right rear wheels. The benefits are superior all-weather handling, and neutral, accurate steering under power.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the 2019 Honda Pilot\'s 9-speed automatic transmission, available in Touring and Elite trims, gets new tuning for enhanced drivability and smoother shifts, while Pilot\'s Idle Stop system now provides quicker restarts and more seamless operation.\r\n\r\nEXTERIOR AND INTERIOR DESIGN\r\n\r\nThe 2019 Honda Pilot\'s updated exterior reflects its off-road capabilities without losing what makes Pilot a perennial favorite in the midsize SUV segment. The front sports an aggressive new front fascia with standard LED low-beam headlights, while the rear features new taillights, a new bumper, and chrome accents.\r\n\r\nThe new front bumper incorporates larger fog light housings, fully integrated into the bumper, giving the 2019 Pilot a more aggressive look. A redesigned grille features a bold interpretation of the Honda \"flying wing\" grille design, with its chrome band extending above the headlights. Further emphasizing the off-road aggressiveness is a new \"skid\" garnish on the lower portion of the front bumper.\r\n\r\nAvailable fog lights are now LED, the turn signal is thinner, and Honda Pilot Elite models benefit from multi-element full LED headlights, including high beams. Additionally, Pilot Elite models receive power folding mirrors with automatic dimming.\r\n\r\nThe rear receives new taillights with amber turn signals and LED backup lights. A chrome strip on the rocker extends along the side of the vehicle, wrapping around the rear bumper and highlighting the lower bumper\'s skid-type design. Wheels are also more ruggedly styled, with 18-inch designs on LX, EX and EX-L, and an aggressive new 20-inch design on Touring and Elite trims.\r\n\r\nA hands-free power tailgate is available for the first time on Pilot on Touring and Elite grades. With the remote key fob in their pocket or handbag, the driver simply kicks their foot under a designated area of the rear bumper. The tailgate then opens without the owner needing to use their hands--very useful for occasions when their hands are full.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its numerous technology upgrades (described below), updates to Pilot\'s interior include new trim around the vents, available 3-way heated front seats, and wider fold-down armrests for the driver and front passenger.

A large dose of bad luck, along with the impossibility of fighting on equal terms with other manufacturers due to an unhelpful Balance of Performance (BOP), kept the 488 GTEs of AF Corse off the podium. It was better in the GTE-Am class with two podium finishes thanks to Spirit of Race and Keating Motorsports-Risi Competizione.\r\nThe race of the Ferrari crews in GTE-Pro class was immediately affected by incidents. A puncture during the third hour forced James Calado to limp from the Michelin chicane to the pits, losing practically a lap. The first Safety Car phase then split the group into three sections, with Porsche no. 92 out on its own behind Safety Car A, all the rest of the GT cars stuck behind Safety Car B car and no. 51 behind the third Safety Car. This cut world champions Calado and Pier Guidi along with Daniel Serra out of the leading group. During the following neutralisation, car no. 71 found itself with a damaged front splitter due to debris from another car and lost a few laps for repairs. The 488 GTE stayed in the race and crossed the finish line in tenth place, earning championship points. Antonio Giovinazzi, Pipo Derani and Toni Vilander in car no. 52 benefited from the Safety Car, moving up into second. During the night Calado, Pier Guidi and Serra lapped like metronomes rising to sixth position before dropping back to eighth due to a shock absorber problem. However, this finish was worth fifth place in terms of points, as only cars entered in the FIA World Endurance Championship are elegible for. Car no. 52, on the other hand, suffered three stops&go’s for speeding in the slow zone and the pits but finished in sixth. Victory went to Christensen-Estre-Vanthoor in the Porsche no. 92.\r\nAs usual, Ferrari customer teams played a leading role in the GTE-Am. In this class too, Porsche made the most of the favourable configuration imposed by the regulations, but Spirit of Race, Keating Motorsport-Risi Competizione and JMW Motorsport teams, later delayed by a series of problems, were in the fight. Giancarlo Fisichella started out like a lion and even led for a time before having to content himself with a fight for a podium place when car no. 77 of Campbell-Ried-Andlauer took a decisive lead. After a difficult start the Keating Motorsports crew pulled off a perfect comeback thanks to solid stints from Ben Keating, Jeroen Bleekemolen and Lucas Stolz. In the final stage Keating’s mistake gave Flohr, Castellacci and Fisichella second position but a podium was never in doubt. The Ferrari of JMW Motorsport (MacNeil-Griffin-Segal) finished fifth while the car of Clearwater Racing (Griffin-Mok-Sawa) was eighth, ahead of the 488 GTE of MR Racing (Ishikawa-Beretta-Cheever III). The overall win went to the Toyota of Alonso-Nakajima-Buemi.',

The RDX team\'s ultimate goal was straightforward: to make the best RDX ever, a vehicle that sets the foundation for an entire new generation of Acura vehicles in terms of styling, performance, premium quality and technology.\r\n\r\nThe RDX redesign features a new-from-the-ground-up, Acura-exclusive platform, a powerful, responsive and efficient new powertrain, and a more spacious, premium and tech-savvy cabin. With its new turbocharged engine, segment-first 10-speed transmission and the newest generation of available Acura Super Handling All-Wheel Drive™ (SH-AWD®), the new RDX is also the quickest, best-handling RDX ever; and with its new longer and wider platform, the 2019 Acura RDX also boasts top-class cabin and cargo space with exceptional comfort, utility and versatility.',

With its black-panel look, it almost dissolves into a large, black surface when switched off. Simple, easy-to-understand symbols stand for the digital precision from Audi and for the high level of integration of the architecture and operation - simplicity replaces complexity. All fundamental lines originate from the large display, for example the continuous air vent strip with integrated chrome fins and an elegant aluminium-look strip.\r\n\r\nThe slender dashboard and the calm lines with a strong horizontal focus highlight the impression of width conveyed by the interior of the Audi Q8. The styling in the interior is deliberately clean and simple. All elements have a logical connection and harmonise with one another: from the \"wrap around\" - the large arch running from the front doors across the instrument panel - to the operating unit for the light, which is finished in a black-panel look with a touch surface. All this combined gives the interior a feeling of calm.\r\n\r\nDesigned as an independent geometric body, the console of the centre tunnel with its generous area visualises the robust character of the SUV. In the dark, the contour light traces the distinctive design lines of the interior and provides backlight for the three-dimensionally lasered quattro badge above the glove compartment - an example for the love of detail at Audi.',
