Likewise, the function of the electronically controlled dampers, the stability control system DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) and the four-wheel drive system are precisely oriented to the selected driving mode.

As you would expect from a factory GTS, the basic equipment package is extensive. For example, the Sport Design package with black exterior elements and large Alcantara surfaces in the interior is included as standard. What\'s more, Porsche has expanded its portfolio of comfort and assis-tance systems to include a head-up display with various configuration options for the entire Panamera range.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of both of the new Porsche Panamera GTS models is a four-litre V8 engine with 338 kW (460 hp) of output and maximum torque of 620 Nm, cultivating an emotional sound and driving experience when combined with the standard sports exhaust sys-tem. The biturbo engine, which features a gasoline particulate filter, outperforms its predecessor by 15 kW (20 hp) and 100 Nm, accelerating the Porsche Panamera GTS and Panamera GTS Sport Turismo from 0 to 100 km/h in 4.1 seconds as it works in con-junction with the standard Sport Chrono Package. The two models achieve a top speed of 292 and 289 km/h, respectively. There are no interruptions in tractive force as power is transmitted to the Porsche Traction Management (PTM) four-wheel drive system by the eight-speed PDK dual clutch gearbox. Their exceptional performance is achieved with moderate consumption of just 10.3 l/100 km (Sport Turismo: 10.6 l/100 km); it has a CO2 emission level of 235 g/km (Sport Turismo: 242 g/km).',

The sports car will be built at the BMW Dingolfing plant, which is also home to the BMW 7-Series sedans meaning that it has acquired tremendous expertise in the manufacture of luxury vehicles. The digit 8 in the model name is indicative of the newcomer\'s high-ranking status within BMW\'s product range. As in the past with the BMW Z8 and also with the current BMW i8, it is reserved for exceptionally sporty cars that fire the emotions. The BMW 8-Series Coupe will therefore be a key component of the luxury segment model offensive set out by the BMW Group as part of its NUMBER ONE > NEXT strategy.\r\n\r\nThe primary development objective for the new BMW 8-Series Coupe was thrilling driving dynamics.
