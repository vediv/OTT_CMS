The touchscreen can house one application, such as the navigation map, across the whole 12-inch screen, or can be divided in half, operating two different applications at once. An all-new toggle switch bank lies below the touchscreen giving physical control of specific features. An active noise cancellation system on 5.7-liter HEMI V-8 equipped models and acoustic glass reduce ambient sounds down to a low 67.1 db - the quietest Ram 1500 ever.\r\n\r\nNew features gave designers the opportunity to reinvent the Human Machine Interface. Across all trim levels, the 2019 Ram 1500 features push-button start, an electronic parking brake and a redesigned rotary e-shifter dial. The new shifter area also intelligently groups new feature buttons, including engine stop-start from eTorque, Hill-decent Control, axle lock and transfer case controls, when equipped.\r\n\r\nThe center stack has been raised and brought closer to the driver to accommodate the 12-inch Uconnect touchscreen and improve overall reachability of system controls.',

As the truck\'s backbone, the frame uses advanced materials and engineering to eliminate 100 pounds while increasing stiffness and durability for 12,750 pounds of towing capability and 2,300 pounds of payload.\r\n\r\nAn all-new eTorque system delivers improved fuel efficiency in both V-6 and V-8 configurations.\r\n\r\nAs a segment disrupter, the new Uconnect 4C with a massive 12-inch touchscreen leads the pickup world with technology featuring split-screen capability, 360-degree camera views and exclusive content from SiriusXM with 360L.\r\n\r\nActive safety and security systems join the technology onslaught with adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, Blind-spot Monitoring and ready alert braking.\r\n\r\nThe new Ram 1500 uses the longest, lightest and most efficient frame in the half-ton truck segment. The chassis has reduced weight by 120 pounds - 100 pounds from the frame alone delivering a maximum payload of 2,300 pounds and maximum trailer tow capacity of 12,750 pounds. The strongest Ram 1500 frame ever produced includes the same impact countermeasures across all configurations, and is made from 98 percent high-strength steel. Exclusive front splayed frame rail technology (patent pending) creates a highly efficient energy absorbing structure for all impact modes, including front-offset with frame integration forward of front tire. Also, frame-mounted high-strength steel tire blockers are placed behind the front tires to force wheels outward in the event of impact. Additionally, side rails are taller and fully boxed. To further improve NVH, new electronically controlled side-frame-mounted active tuned-mass modules (ATMM) work in harmony with an interior active noise cancellation (ANC) system on 5.7-liter HEMI V-8 equipped models to reduce ambient sounds down to a low 67.1 db - the quietest Ram 1500 ever.

Four key values characterize the interior concept: progressiveness, sportiness, intuitiveness and sophistication. All colors, upholstery materials and inlays underscore the new aesthetic, from the base version to the design selection, the S line sport package and the particularly sophisticated Valcona leather. The optional contour ambient lighting package traces the contours and subtly highlights the space. The 10.1-inch upper display (in combination with MMI navigation plus) is tilted toward the driver. With its black panel optics and framed in a graphite gray aluminum clasp, it almost disappears into the dashboard when switched off. The body supporting the clasp is itself a geometric sculpture.

The four-door coupe sets standards in the luxury class when it comes to progressiveness. It embodies a new style of Gran Turismo, with dynamic lines, systematic digitalization, a sporty driving experience and a versatile space concept.\r\n\r\nThe exterior design of the Audi A7 Sportback is an expression of the new design language that Audi introduced with the prologue study and made its production debut in the new Audi A8. With large surfaces, sharp edges and taut, athletic lines, the A7 signals dynamics and progressiveness from every perspective.\r\n\r\nUp front, the Singleframe grille - wider and lower than that of the Audi A8 - the narrow headlights, the boldly contoured air inlets and the flat front end convey at a glance the sportiness of the Gran Turismo. The headlights are available in three versions. With the middle and top equipment lines, the light signature takes up the subject of digitalization: 12 adjacent lighting segments separated by narrow intervening spaces evoke associations with the binary digits 0 and 1. The top version is the HD Matrix LED headlights with Audi laser light.\r\n\r\nThe Audi A7 Sportback is an athletic sculpture with a long engine hood, long wheelbase and short overhangs. Pronounced contours emphasize the wheels, which measure up to 21 inches in diameter, and reference Audi\'s quattro genes. These genes determine the proportions of the vehicle\'s body. The silhouette is defined by the dynamic roofline, which drops sharply toward the rear. Four figures delineate the sporty character of the large coupe: It is 4,969 millimeters (16.3 ft) long, has a wheelbase of 2,926 millimeters (9.6 ft) and is 1,908 millimeters (6.3 ft) wide, but stands only 1,422 millimeters (4.7 ft) high.',

This new form even inspired the name of the Xmotion concept itself and sets the stage for use on production crossovers and SUVs well into the next decade.\r\n\r\nAdding to its powerful shape and presence, the new grille design features horizontal bars inspired by Japanese architecture and executed in a sharp, blade-like appearance with its deep carbon color and high-gloss finish completing the grille\'s dramatic appearance.\r\n\r\nThe sharp-edged design theme carries over to the Nissan Xmotion concept\'s interpretation of the signature Nissan \"boomerang\" headlamps, which resemble forged steel blades. The headlamps integrate all functions into a single unit - high beam, low beam, turn signals and positioning lamps. The intensity and color of the lighting changes depending on the function.\r\n\r\nIn the rear, the unique taillight design was inspired by the detail and warmth of kumiko, Japanese woodwork and puzzles. The structure of the lights is, in fact, an optical illusion created by hologram technology.\r\n\r\nOn the sides of the Xmotion concept, innovative U-shaped bodyside highlights impart a highly sculptural presence while creating a smooth, unbroken visual flow from front to rear fenders.

The four-door coupe sets standards in the luxury class when it comes to progressiveness. It embodies a new style of Gran Turismo, with dynamic lines, systematic digitalization, a sporty driving experience and a versatile space concept.\r\n\r\nThe exterior design of the Audi A7 Sportback is an expression of the new design language that Audi introduced with the prologue study and made its production debut in the new Audi A8. With large surfaces, sharp edges and taut, athletic lines, the A7 signals dynamics and progressiveness from every perspective.\r\n\r\nUp front, the Singleframe grille - wider and lower than that of the Audi A8 - the narrow headlights, the boldly contoured air inlets and the flat front end convey at a glance the sportiness of the Gran Turismo. The headlights are available in three versions. With the middle and top equipment lines, the light signature takes up the subject of digitalization: 12 adjacent lighting segments separated by narrow intervening spaces evoke associations with the binary digits 0 and 1. The top version is the HD Matrix LED headlights with Audi laser light.\r\n\r\nThe Audi A7 Sportback is an athletic sculpture with a long engine hood, long wheelbase and short overhangs. Pronounced contours emphasize the wheels, which measure up to 21 inches in diameter, and reference Audi\'s quattro genes. These genes determine the proportions of the vehicle\'s body. The silhouette is defined by the dynamic roofline, which drops sharply toward the rear. Four figures delineate the sporty character of the large coupe: It is 4,969 millimeters (16.3 ft) long, has a wheelbase of 2,926 millimeters (9.6 ft) and is 1,908 millimeters (6.3 ft) wide, but stands only 1,422 millimeters (4.7 ft) high.',

Visually, the two displays under one shared glass cover blend into a Widescreen Cockpit and as a central element consequently emphasise the horizontal orientation of the interior design.\r\n\r\nBy way of instrument cluster, the optional Widescreen Cockpit contains a large display with virtual instruments in the direct field of vision of the driver, as well as a central display above the centre console. Because the cockpit is fully digital, the driver can choose the look from the three different display styles \"Classic\", \"Sporty\" and \"Progressive\" and also configure the information and views relevant to him/her at will. Via the AMG menu, it is possible to display the engine and transmission oil temperature, lateral and longitudinal acceleration, engine output and torque, boost (charge pressure), tyre temperatures and pressures as well as the current vehicle set-up.\r\n\r\nThe touch-sensitive Touch Control buttons on the steering wheel respond to swiping movements. They enable the driver to control the entire infotainment system without having to take his/her hands off the steering wheel.\r\n\r\nThe infotainment system can also be operated via the touchpad with controller in the centre console and by LINGUATRONIC voice control. Voice control has been extended to include vehicle functions. Now the air conditioning and seat heating/ventilation, interior lights and the optional head-up display can also be controlled by voice commands.',

The instrument panel has contrast stitching and decorative stitching as standard, while the centre console features materials including Sensatec with contrast stitching. The interior of the M Sport and M Sport X models is trimmed in a Micro Hexagon fabric/Alcantara Anthracite combination. Eyecatching highlights can be added by opting for the newly available perforated Dakota leather in Magma Red or the Micro Hexagon fabric/Alcantara Anthracite combination upholstery with yellow contrast stitching to match the Galvanic Gold metallic exterior paint shade. The new BMW X2 deftly combines all of this with a generous helping of everyday practicality. The boot has a capacity of 470 litres, meaning it can effortlessly handle leisure activities, from shopping sprees to a skiing weekend or mountain-bike tour. This high level of functionality manifests itself in the passenger compartment too, thanks to features such as a door design featuring large pockets and stowage bins lower down.',

The Nissan 370Zki makes its world debut this week at the 2018 Chicago Auto Show. Transforming the factory stock 370Z Roadster to the snow track-carving 370Zki presented a few understandable obstacles. To make room for the rear DOMINATOR Tracks from American Track Truck, Inc., the entire drivetrain was first removed from the 370Z Roadster. Then a custom lift kit was designed and engineered, lifting the vehicle three inches from the normal height. Next came fabrication of custom mountings for the rear suspension springs and three-inch custom spacers to mount the snow tracks to the wheel hubs. The factory brakes were retained but the brake lines had to be rerouted and the exhaust system was modified to fit under the vehicle. The rear wheel wells were also modified for clearance of the four-foot-long snow tracks.',

The front apron in an A-wing design is equipped with black flics and a front splitter in silver chrome. The outer air intakes have two horizontal fins in silver chrome. AMG-specific side sill panels lend the 53-series models a more dynamic silhouette. When viewed from the rear, it is not just the redesigned rear apron that stands out, but also the classic, round twin tailpipe trim elements in high-gloss chrome. The design of the sides of the mud flaps improves the aerodynamics at the rear: As a result this provides for better air flow around the wheel arches.

On the basis of a compact two-box design, optimised dimensions and proportions have led to a new interpretation of the Mercedes-Benz A-Class\'s design. The exterior of the new Mercedes-Benz A-Class stands for sportiness, dynamism and emotion. The progressive front design with a low bonnet, flat LED headlamps with chrome elements and torch-like daytime driving lamps ensures an emotionally appealing and alluring appearance. The striking radiator grille with Mercedes star, whose silhouette opens out towards the base as a reinterpretation of its predecessor, features pins in a diamond look and a central silver louvre to underline the sportiness of this model. The prominent air inlets in the lower area of the bumper echo the silhouette of the radiator grille. The vehicle is visually extended by the longer wheelbase and character line along the side. The bonnet slopes down more heavily than in the preceding model series, emphasising the dynamic, upright front. The larger wheel arches for wheels from 16 to 19 inches emphasise the sportiness of the new A-Class and make it sit more squarely on the road.',

It completely redefines modern luxury in the compact class, and revolutionises interior design. Technologically the new A-Class not only takes first place thanks to MBUX - Mercedes-Benz User Experience: it also offers a number of functions that were previously the preserve of the luxury class. In certain driving situations, it is able to drive semi-autonomously for the first time, and MULTIBEAM LED headlamps are available on request. All models of the new A-Class are also powered by new, efficient diesel and petrol engines, and although Mercedes-Benz has retained the sporty appearance, the utility value has increased.',
