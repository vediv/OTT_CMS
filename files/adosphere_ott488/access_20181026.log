In mid-2019 the time has now come: The EQC is the first Mercedes-Benz vehicle to be launched under the EQ brand. With its seamless, clear design and colour highlights typical of the brand, it is a pioneer for an avant-garde electric look while representing the design idiom of Progressive Luxury. With respect to quality, safety and comfort the EQC is the Mercedes-Benz among electric vehicles, and highly convincing in the sum of its attributes. These are accompanied by dynamic performance, thanks to two electric motors at the front and rear axles with a combined output of 300 kW. A sophisticated operating strategy enables an electric range of more than 450 km according to NEDC. EQ also offers comprehensive services with Mercedes me, and makes electromobility convenient and suitable for day-to-day motoring. The Mercedes-Benz EQC also symbolises the start of a new mobility era at Daimler.\r\n\r\nAs the first Mercedes-Benz model under the new product and technology brand EQ, the Mercedes-Benz EQC has many trailblazing design details and colour highlights typical of the brand. Both inside and out, the EQC embodies the design idiom of Progressive Luxury. This arises from the combination of a previously unknown beauty, the conscious clash of digital and analogue elements as well as the seamless merging of intuitive and physical design.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of its muscular proportions, the Mercedes-Benz EQC is classed as a crossover SUV. The extended roofline and window layout with a low waistline and the coupé-like roof recess at the rear visually position it between an SUV and an SUV coupé.',

But accidents can be avoided with the right car, equipment and options, such as the new Opel Combo compact van with IntelliGrip adaptive traction control and Worksite pack.IntelliGrip endows the front-wheel drive Combo – the 2019 International Van of the Year – with optimum traction and stability in a variety of driving conditions. Depending on the surface, the driver simply selects the appropriate traction control mode via the rotary dial on the centre console. The electronics then immediately adapt torque distribution to the wheels and the ESP settings (electronic stability program) to the selected mode.\r\n\r\nIntelliGrip features the following five modes:\r\n\r\n    Normal / On-road: ‘Normal mode’ is activated as soon as the Combo is started. ESP and traction control are calibrated for normal driving conditions downtown, on the motorway or in the countryside.\r\n    Snow: ‘Snow mode’ enables optimum traction on icy and snowy surfaces at speeds up to 50 km/h. Traction control regulates the slip of the front wheels, slowing down the spinning wheel and transferring the torque to the other front wheel.\r\n    Mud: This mode allows more wheel slip. This intentional spinning of the wheel with the least traction when the vehicle is launching enables the removal of mud from the tire, which can then regain traction. Meanwhile, the wheel with the most grip is provided with the highest torque. This mode is active up to 80 km/h.\r\n    Sand: This mode allows a small amount of simultaneous spin of both the front-driven wheels, enabling the vehicle to move and reducing the risk of sinking.\r\n    ESP Off: This deactivates ESP and traction control at speeds up to 50 km/h. For safety reasons, IntelliGrip automatically returns to ‘normal mode’ at speeds above 50 km/h.',

In the meantime, thesixth model generation has lined up on the starting grid – more powerful than ever before while at the same time inimitably part of the heritage. This tradition was launched 33 years ago with the development of the first BMW M5 and the associated establishment of a completely new vehicle category.The BMW M5 combines the driving characteristics of a blue riband sportscar with the comfort and functionality features of a luxury saloon.The fact that no compromises are necessary is a tribute to the harmony typical of BMW Mautomobilesencompassed in the overall concept of engine, power transmission, chassis and design. Thisphilosophy empowered the BMW M5 Story to become an exceptional tale of success. Technological progress combined with an evolutionary change in theengine and drive concept have ensured that each new model generation moves forward toascend even higher dimensions of dynamic driving performance. This progress does notimpact on the essence of the driver’s experience. Regardless of the number of cylinders and the powered wheels, BMW M5 guarantees development of power that is spontaneous while  being sustained over a long period of time thanks to the high-revving concept. Additional features are provided by exceptional agility and secure handling characteristics onthe road alongside superior dynamic performance on the race track. Another element ofconstancy threading through the BMW M5 Story is the understatement inherent in the automobile’s appearance. The model - specific design attributes of the high - performance saloon harmonises with the fundamental look of the BMW 5 Series.',

Apart from the sportier design, the Audi R8 Coupé and Spyder have more powerful engines. The models will go on sale in Europe in early 2019.\r\n\r\n“The R8 occupies a unique position for Audi in every respect,” says Michael-Julius Renz, Managing Director of Audi Sport GmbH. “It’s now even more powerful and faster.” adds Oliver Hoffmann, Technical Managing Director of Audi Sport GmbH: “Motorsport is part of our DNA. With around 50 percent shared parts with the R8 LMS GT3 and even 60 percent with the R8 LMS GT4, no other automobile is so close to motor racing as the R8.”\r\n\r\nInstant response, lightning-fast high-revving and a unique sound – the heart of the Audi R8 is its V10 naturally aspirated engine. It is available to customers in two output ratings. The almost identical drive technology of the V10 engine in the R8 LMS GT3 and R8 LMS GT4 is put to good use on the racetrack. The V10, which is produced at the engine plant in Győr, Hungary, is very compact. A separate radiator controls the temperature of the engine oil, which comes from a dry sump. This principle was adopted from motor racing and allows for an extremely low installation position of the engine, producing a low center of gravity. The pump module operates with multiple suction stages and assures proper lubrication under all conditions – including during lateral acceleration of around 1.5 G, which is possible in the R8. Both engines have a gasoline particulate filter.',
