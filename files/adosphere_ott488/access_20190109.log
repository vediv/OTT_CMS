A quick anticipation of the video that will reveal the development of the exclusive Italian Hypercar and that will be released in the next months. It’s almost Christmas, and for Luca Mazzanti is time to disclose the balance of 2017: “2017 was a really challenging year for us, but full of success too; we were invited to numerous exclusive events, starting from the success gained by the Evantra 771 displayed at Salone di Torino, at the several dynamics events that brought our cars close to the fans, until the spectacular absolute ninth place at 24 Hours of Le Mans together with Cetilar Villorba Corse. We had the pleasure to welcome many journalists and bloggers from all over the world that had thus the chance of deeply undestanding the secrets of the Mazzanti Automobili tailor-made world. This year in our atelier in Pontedera, the commitment of everyone has been constant: with the development on the Evantra Millecavalli and the upgrades on the Evantra standard and 771, in line with my usual style, I wanted to push the limit even higher.. in the next months you will find out what I am referring to. For this reason, I want to thank my magnificent staff that allows Mazzanti automobili to reach and overtake, day after day, important goals: Tony Andreetta, Carlo Beconcini, Loris Bicocchi, Tonino Cecere, Niccolò Englaro, Davide Ingrisani, Ros Mazzanti, Nico Meo, Andrea Quaglia, Federico Zornetta and Nicola Xella. Each of them, in his own way, contributed at his best for Mazzanti Automobili; their work, together with the one of the partners that I personally wanted to thank at the end of the teaser, is a silent and fundamental work, as well as the support of my family is silent and constant. To each of them as well as to each of you now reading these lines, I want to wish a Merry Christmas and a 2018 full of success”. Luca Mazzanti.   ',

The design language appears reduced and matter-of-fact; the horizontal lines create an airy sense of space. The center console and the two MMI touch response displays are angled slightly toward the driver. When switched off, the top display is incorporated almost invisibly into the dark decorative surface.\r\nThe A6 is perfectly equipped for long journeys with new convenience functions. The seats are all-new. The top-of-the-line options include the customized contour front seats with numerous adjustment functions, optionally fitted with ventilation and massage function. The optional air quality package provides a subtle fragrance and improves the air with an ionizer. The optional panoramic glass sunroof floods the interior with light. The luggage compartment, with its capacity of 530 liters (18.7 cu ft) will accommodate two golf bags crosswise, while the trunk lid can be closed electrically with a kicking motion as an option.\r\nThe low noise level of the Audi A6 also makes it an ideal long-distance specialist. The body structure is a major factor in achieving this.Designed with a mixed steel and aluminum construction, the body is extremely rigid. It provides the basis for high torsional stiffness, minimal body movement and the sporty, precise handling. With a drag coefficient of 0.24 (with an engine to be released subsequently) the new Audi A6 cuts effortlessly through the wind. Thanks to its sophisticated aeroacoustics, including acoustic glass, it remains very quiet in the interior, even at high speeds.',

The all-digital MMI touch response system provides intuitive operation and even more personalization. The extensive connectivity and assistance systems demonstrate intelligent automotive connectivity. The suspension combines smooth ride comfort and unshakable stability with enhanced sportiness. All engines use an efficient mild hybrid system.\r\n\r\nFast access to functions and a high degree of customization - the smartphone-like display and operating system makes use intuitive in the Audi A6. It is thus the most modern operating concept in its class. Two large displays replace most of the buttons and controls of the predecessor model. As such it is a prime example of the end-to-end digitalization which the new A6 brings to the business class. The all-digital operating system also supports a high degree of personalization. In the top display, the buttons for all functions can be placed freely, similar to the user experience with smartphone apps. In the bottom display, the user can create up to 27 individual shortcuts for the key vehicle functions and often used favorites such as phone numbers, radio stations or navigation destinations.\r\n\r\nUsers hear and feel a click as confirmation as soon as their finger triggers a function by lightly pressing the touch-sensitive display. The user can adjust the intensity of this acoustic and tactile feedback as required. The driver manages the infotainment on the top display, which has a 10.1-inch screen diagonal if MMI navigation plus has been specified. The bottom 8.6-inch display, located in the console in the center tunnel, is used for the climate control, the convenience and vehicle functions as well as for text input; the driver\'s wrist can sit comfortably on the selector lever of the transmission.',
