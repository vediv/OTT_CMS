With its fully autonomous driving level ve, the Nucleus jumps two generations ahead. Inside the vehicle, the absence of a driver does not only mean the absence of a steering wheel and a dashboard, but the opportunity for a new understanding of mobile living spaces, where the focus is no longer the road but the destination. Technology should be felt but not seen and so a “less is more approach” has been used, resulting in a uid and sculptural body that combines the needs of both aerodynamics and ergonomics.

With its fully autonomous driving level ve, the Nucleus jumps two generations ahead. Inside the vehicle, the absence of a driver does not only mean the absence of a steering wheel and a dashboard, but the opportunity for a new understanding of mobile living spaces, where the focus is no longer the road but the destination. Technology should be felt but not seen and so a “less is more approach” has been used, resulting in a uid and sculptural body that combines the needs of both aerodynamics and ergonomics.

The central armrest in the front with storage compartment, the big door pockets, two cup holders and a new, closed stowage compartment beneath the rotary light switch further increase the car\'s everyday usability. One standard feature offering additional convenience to the driver and front passenger is the seat belt height adjustment featuring extending and retracting power belt feeds.

The backrests can be folded forward in the ratio 40:20:40 using the remote unlocking feature in the trunk. The luggage compartment offers ten liters (0.4 cu ft) more volume than before. It now holds a best-in-segment value of 465 liters (16.4 cu ft). The tailgate opens automatically and the two-door Coupe can be ordered from Audi with optional sensor control.

The designers drew inspiration for the RS5 Coupe from the distinctive racing details of the Audi 90 quattro IMSA GTO. Massive air inlets with the honeycomb structure typical of RS models characterize the front end of the car. The Singleframe radiator grille is much wider and flatter than in the base model. Next to the headlights are additional lateral air intakes and outlets; tinted bezels differentiate the optional Matrix LED headlights. quattro blisters on the flanks emphasize the pronounced bulges over the wheel arches, which have been widened by 15 millimeters (0.6 in). As standard, these house 19-inch forged aluminum wheels, with 20-inch wheels available as an option. A sporty conclusion to the vehicle is provided by the RS-specific diffuser insert, the oval tailpipes of the RS exhaust system and a surface-mounted spoiler lip.
