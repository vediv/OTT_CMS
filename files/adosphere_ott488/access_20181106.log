The new BMW 8 Series Convertible has been created to provide sporty performance and a luxurious open-top driving experience. One of the factors contributing to the driving enjoyment offered by this new convertible for the luxury segment is the design of the high-quality interior, with its precisely crafted details. The cohesive harmony between the exterior and interior is revealed particularly effectively when the soft-top is down. The occupants of the four seats are surrounded by the sweeping flow of the instrument panel, the door shoulders, the shoulder area around the rear seats and the soft-top compartment cover. Flush joints between the side channel seals and the surround of the soft-top compartment underline the harmonious transition from front to rear.',

Behind we find an oscillating swingarm with mono central adjustable spring preload, with a 45mm excursion.
