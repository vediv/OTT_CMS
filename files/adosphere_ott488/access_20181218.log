The standard jewel-like LED headlights and Nissan Signature Daytime Running Lights add to the Nissan Maxima\'s premium, high performance appearance, along with the new, deep fascia design.\r\n\r\nThe new rear fascia includes integrated quad-tip exhaust finishers, while a new sport rear spoiler is also added to the Maxima SR grade. New wheel designs have been developed for all five Maxima grade levels - capped off by the new 19-inch Hyper Silver Platinum Reserve Package wheels. In addition, a new premium exterior paint color, Sunset Drift, has been added to the Maxima color palette.\r\n\r\nInside, the dramatic Nissan Maxima body is a driver-oriented cockpit and comfortable seating for all five occupants. Enhancing the Maxima\'s already high level of quality and premium luxury appointments is a new seat insert pattern and charcoal headliner and pillars for SR and Platinum Reserve Package grades. The Platinum Reserve Package features special Rakuda Tan semi-aniline leather appointments, similar to that available on the Nissan GT-R Premium Interior Package.\r\n\r\nThe interior retains the Maxima\'s \"Gliding Wing\" interior layout that emphasizes the horizontal movement and easy access to all controls, but offers updated trim finishers and materials. Depending on grade level, the instrument panel, door panels, steering wheel insert, stitching, seat materials, headliner, pillars and A-pillar speaker grilles have been upgraded, providing a more premium look and feel.',

Alongside Vice President Product lines 911 and 718, “Mr 911” August Achleitner, who was keen to learn what the former racing driver thought, Webber had the chance to inspect the car with its camouflage almost completely removed. Returning from his fast laps at Porsche’s development centre in Weissach, he said: “In a word, that was awesome. There are so many highlights. The wide front axle, for example, seemed to give it greater cornering performance and turning-in became even more precise. The different front and back wheel sizes make a big difference to stability when you’re changing direction quickly too. As for the design, I love it: it’s very clear and typical Porsche.” The video, featuring all of Webber’s impressions, is ready at newsTV.porsche.com.

And the new car puts down another marker in terms of design and technology. The new BMW X5 will again be built at BMW Plant Spartanburg in the US state of South Carolina. This centre of expertise for BMW X models also handles production of the BMW X3, BMW X4, BMW X6 - and will soon add the BMW X7 to its roster as well.
