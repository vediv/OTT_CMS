When in Drive and under light-to-moderate throttle, the 9AT will now start in second gear for smoother launch and lower speed acceleration. The transmission also defaults to second-gear launches when the Intelligent Traction Management (ITM) switch is in Snow mode. At full throttle, with steep grades, in S mode, or with the ITM in Sand or Mud, the 9AT will start in first gear.\r\n\r\nPilot also has an upgraded Idle Stop system. Fully integrated with the new second-gear launch mode, it features new programming and a new brake pressure trigger for quicker restarts when accelerating immediately after engine stop, making the system less noticeable in heavy traffic and similar driving situations. The air conditioning has been reconfigured as well to reduce engine restarts. Additionally, when in idle stop, the engine remains off after shifting to Park for a more intuitive driving experience.',

Standard on all AWD trims, i-VTM4 uses an electronically-controlled, hydraulically-actuated rear differential to apportion engine torque between the front and rear axles, and dynamically distribute torque between the left and right rear wheels. The benefits are superior all-weather handling, and neutral, accurate steering under power.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the 2019 Honda Pilot\'s 9-speed automatic transmission, available in Touring and Elite trims, gets new tuning for enhanced drivability and smoother shifts, while Pilot\'s Idle Stop system now provides quicker restarts and more seamless operation.\r\n\r\nEXTERIOR AND INTERIOR DESIGN\r\n\r\nThe 2019 Honda Pilot\'s updated exterior reflects its off-road capabilities without losing what makes Pilot a perennial favorite in the midsize SUV segment. The front sports an aggressive new front fascia with standard LED low-beam headlights, while the rear features new taillights, a new bumper, and chrome accents.\r\n\r\nThe new front bumper incorporates larger fog light housings, fully integrated into the bumper, giving the 2019 Pilot a more aggressive look. A redesigned grille features a bold interpretation of the Honda \"flying wing\" grille design, with its chrome band extending above the headlights. Further emphasizing the off-road aggressiveness is a new \"skid\" garnish on the lower portion of the front bumper.\r\n\r\nAvailable fog lights are now LED, the turn signal is thinner, and Honda Pilot Elite models benefit from multi-element full LED headlights, including high beams. Additionally, Pilot Elite models receive power folding mirrors with automatic dimming.\r\n\r\nThe rear receives new taillights with amber turn signals and LED backup lights. A chrome strip on the rocker extends along the side of the vehicle, wrapping around the rear bumper and highlighting the lower bumper\'s skid-type design. Wheels are also more ruggedly styled, with 18-inch designs on LX, EX and EX-L, and an aggressive new 20-inch design on Touring and Elite trims.\r\n\r\nA hands-free power tailgate is available for the first time on Pilot on Touring and Elite grades. With the remote key fob in their pocket or handbag, the driver simply kicks their foot under a designated area of the rear bumper. The tailgate then opens without the owner needing to use their hands--very useful for occasions when their hands are full.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its numerous technology upgrades (described below), updates to Pilot\'s interior include new trim around the vents, available 3-way heated front seats, and wider fold-down armrests for the driver and front passenger. Additionally, second-row captain\'s chairs are now available on both Touring and Elite models (previously Elite only) and second-row retractable sunshades are available on EX-L, Touring and Elite grades.',

In crafting the exterior appearance of Ioniq, Hyundai designers concentrated on its future-focused character, fundamental to its appeal. A fluid exterior shape and natural air flow channels emphasize aerodynamic body lines and surface volumes. A sporty, hatchback-like profile is inspired by aerodynamic efficiency, complementing the soft lines and surfaces that trace the car’s outline. These attributes combine to boost aerodynamics further, which, when combined with various other smart efficiency solutions, produce an industry-leading 0.24 coefficient of drag. In addition to Ioniq aerodynamics, further design details distinguish the Hybrid and Plug-in Hybrid from the Electric models, creating their unique identities.',

A pure driving experience is the main emphasis of the car. The drive technology under the two-tone shell of the concept study is derived from the current GT models. It was developed at the Porsche Motorsport Centre, which is the birth place of the 911 GT2 RS and, most recently, the GT3 RS. The 911 Speedster Concept celebrated its world premiere as part of the official ‘70 years Porsche sportscar’ anniversary celebrations in Zuffenhausen.

While the under-lamp ornamentation -available in Black, Glossy Black or Silver- accentuates the \'X\' signature and the vehicle\'s width.\r\n\r\nIn profile, the more three-dimensional frontal form combines with newly designed outer lenses in the rear lamp clusters to strengthen the visual connection between the front and rear, giving the impression of forward movement and increased dynamism.\r\n\r\nAt the rear, the new LED light guides give the Toyota AYGO a sophisticated look and make the model instantly recognisable. The unique light signature creates the perception of a compact cabin above a wider lower bumper area, to emphasise the vehicle\'s rear width and stability.\r\n\r\nThe new exterior styling is completed with a choice of eight body colours, two of which are new -Rich Blue Metallic and, exclusive to the x-cite grade, Magenta Splash Metallic. The addition of new 15\" technical-look wheel caps and 15\" alloys -with a design unique to each grade- further strengthens the premium looks of the new AYGO.',

Its instantly recognisable, trademark \'X\' frontal design and the broad range of customisation options it offered ensured that it always stood out from the crowd.\r\n\r\nAppealing to a more style-conscious audience than those who buy their cars for purely rational reasons, the AYGO\'s striking good looks and engaging driving characteristics made it one of the best-performing Toyota models for attracting new buyers and conquest sales.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Toyota AYGO was amongst the top sellers of the A-segment with more than 85,000 units sold, and a segment share of 6.6%.\r\n\r\nThe new AYGO further strengthens the model\'s unique DNA and stand-out positioning within the highly-competitive A-segment. Toyota\'s designers and engineers have not only reinforced its youthful and distinctive image, but also made the powertrain more efficient and improved the car\'s performance and handling characteristics to make it even more fun to drive.',

And now the second generation of the successful compact car is rolling to the starting line. Its dynamic design characterizes the new Audi A1 Sportback. It is the ideal companion in the urban environment and is also very well suited for longer journeys. With its infotainment and driver assistance systems on a par with the full-size class, the A1 Sportback is firmly networked with the digital world. New trim lines provide ample opportunity for customization.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new A1 Sportback also emphasizes a resemblance to the Audi Ur-quattro and Sport quattro when viewed from the side: The wide, flat sloping C-pillar seems to push the car forward even while standing still. The roof contrast line, which is available in two dark colors, ends above the C-pillar. This gives the impression that the roof is flatter and the complete car is even lower-slung.\r\n\r\nWith S line equipment, Audi has emphasized the sporty character even more through numerous features. These include larger air inlets, additional sill trims, an elongated slit centrally below the hood with two fins and the larger rear wing. The top-of-the-line engine is also recognizable with its striking twin tailpipes.\r\n\r\n“The sportiest interior in the compact class,” that was the stated aim of the design. The interior is accordingly driver-focused, with its emotive, customizable design. The eye is drawn in particular to the sporty compact unit of air vent nozzles, hood and the digital instrument cluster. All of the controls and the optional MMI touch display are strongly driver-oriented thus emphasizing the special cockpit character.\r\n',
