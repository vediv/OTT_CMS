Though every one of the cars was worthy of the utmost attention, there were some that stood out for their particular story or that of the owner, deserving a special mention at the end of the tour by Stefano Domenicali, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Lamborghini.An award for the car owned the longest by a single owner went to the 1973 Espada Series 3, chassis 9300, purchased as a used car in January 1977 by two English owners. For years it was the only family car, used on a daily basis to go to work and take the children to school.

The driving experience is as pleasant, comfortable and safe as ever with the new driving assist systems offered as standard equipment on all versions.

A BMW R 1200 GS made its first rounds in front of assembled journalists, as if by magic, at the BMW Group testing ground in Miramas, southern France. Developed by graduate engineer Stefan Hans and his team, the vehicle independently drives off, accelerates, circles a winding test track and independently slows down to a stop.\r\n\r\nWith this forward-thinking development, BMW Motorrad, as a driver for technical innovations in the field of motorcycling, is by no means aiming for a completely independent motorbike. Rather, the underlying technology should serve as a platform for development of future systems and functions to make motorcycling even safer, more comfortable and increase the riding pleasure. The aim of the prototype is to gather additional knowledge with regards driving dynamics in order to detect dangerous situations early on and thus support the driver with appropriate safety systems while turning at intersections or when braking suddenly, for example.',
