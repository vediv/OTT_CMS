It continues to set the standard when it comes to exclusive sportiness. Unmistakably committed to the Porsche design DNA, a much more muscular look, and an interior featuring a 10.9-inch touchscreen monitor, the new 911 is timeless - and modern. Intelligent control and chassis elements as well as innovative assistance systems combine the masterfully uncompromising dynamism that the classic rear-engine sportscar is famed for, with the demands of the digital world.\r\n\r\nThe next generation of flat-six turbocharged engines has been further developed and is more powerful than ever before, with 331 kW (450 PS) in the S models. The drive efficiency has been increased by way of an improved injection process and a new layout for the turbochargers and charge air cooling system. The power is delivered by a newly developed eight-speed dual-clutch transmission. Additional highlights include the new assistance systems, including Porsche Wet mode to make driving on wet roads even safer, and Night Vision Assist with thermal imaging camera, as well as comprehensive connectivity - which now also uses swarm intelligence. The 911\'s features are rounded off by three exclusive digital offerings: the Porsche Road Trip app for extraordinary tours, the Porsche 360+ personal assistant, and the web-based Porsche Impact emissions calculator for neutralising your individual carbon footprint.',

The wide, low Singleframe grille and prominent air inlets express the dynamic character of the Gran Turismo at first glance. With the two optional headlight variants, twelve separate horizontal lighting strips create the lighting signature. Topping the line are the HD Matrix LED headlights with Audi laser light, which can be recognized by the blue marker in the reflector.\r\nViewed from the side, pronounced contours emphasize the large wheels –a reference to Audi’s quattro genes. The sharply dropping roof line dominates the silhouette. The large coupé is 4.97 meters (16.3 ft) long and 1.91 meters (6.3 ft) wide, but just 1.42 meters (4.7 ft) high. Its rear is tapered like a yacht. A spoiler integrated into the long luggage compartment lid extends electrically at 120 km/h (74.6 mph). A light strip connects the rear lights, whose outer rear lights comprise 13 segments each. When the doors are unlocked or closed, dynamic lighting animations in the rear lights and headlights showcase the Audi A7.',
