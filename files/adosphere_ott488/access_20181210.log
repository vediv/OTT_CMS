At the same time, the width has remained almost the same at 1.74 (5.7 ft) meters. The new-generation model is only 1.41 meters (4.6 ft) in height - including aerial, the car is 1.43 meters (4.7 ft) tall. The wide track and short overhangs provide for a taut, sporty look. The wide, low-placed Singleframe grille and the implied side air inlets dominate the distinctive front. Below the edge of the hood are three flat slits - an homage to the Sport quattro, the brand\'s rally icon from 1984.\r\n\r\nThe new Audi A1 also emphasizes a resemblance to the Audi Ur-quattro and Sport quattro when viewed from the side: The wide, flat sloping C-pillar seems to push the car forward even while standing still. The roof contrast line, which is available in two dark colors, ends above the C-pillar. This gives the impression that the roof is flatter and the complete car is even lower-slung. All lines on the flanks, from the window edge to the sill, slope upward toward the rear in a wedge shape. The distinctively highlighted wheels and the low shoulder line in between give the A1 Sportback a solid stance on the road. The low line between the fender edges draws the visual focal point downward even further.',

Benchmarked against premium-brand products, it delivers improved ride quality, steering response, body control and NVH management. Evolved in every way, the all-new CR-V delivers more comfort, convenience and connectivity than ever before.\r\n\r\nThe all-new CR-V\'s slightly larger exterior proportions, longer wheelbase and wider stance enable a significantly larger interior.

An expression of pure motion running from the front to the rear of the body conveys agile acceleration and speed. The all-new CX-5 exudes a boldly seductive charm. Its physique emphasises the solid stance and forward momentum with a simple form that beautifully reflects shadows and highlights.\r\n\r\nA lower centre of gravity and 10mm wider front and rear tread give the all-new Mazda CX-5 a more powerful stance. Mazda repositioned the A-pillars some 35mm rearward compared to the current model, also optimising the relative positions of the front axle and A-pillars. The motion conveyed down the sides of the vehicle culminates at the rear with a trapezoidal shape that extends from the liftgate out toward each rear tire. The result is a powerful physique that appears firmly planted from any angle.',
