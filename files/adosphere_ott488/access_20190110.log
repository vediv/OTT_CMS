Four-cylinder engines as TFSI and TDI will extend the portfolio at a later date. All engines provide outstandingly strong power delivery, high efficiency and refined operation. The V6 gasoline engine in the Audi A6 55 TFSI is a 3.0 TFSI, producing 250 kW (340 hp) and 500 Nm (368.8 lb-ft). The 3.0 TDI in the Audi A6 50 TDI in its 210 kW (286 hp) version produces even more torque, i.e. 620 Nm (457.3 lb-ft).\r\n\r\nAll variants of the A6 are fitted standard with automatic transmissions. While the V6 diesel engines are paired with an eight-speed tiptronic, the 3.0 TFSI is coupled as standard with a seven-speed S tronic. All three-liter engines forward their power as standard to the quattro all-wheel drive. In conjunction with the tiptronic, the A6 has a self-locking center differential. With the S tronic, it uses ultra technology, which instantly activates rear-wheel drive as needed. For the V6 TDI, Audi also offers the sport differential as an option - it makes fast cornering even more dynamic and stable by actively distributing the power between the rear wheels.',

With its off-road character and top-class luxury appointments, the G-Class has always combined two extremes into a harmonious symbiosis. Unmistakable at first glance and from the first touch, only high-quality materials are used. Every detail is finished by hand with the utmost care.\r\n\r\nGetting in the G-Class reveals that numerous design features from the exterior have been transposed into the interior. The shape of the round headlamps, for instance, which is reflected in the side air vents. Or the design of the iconic indicators, found again in the shape of the loudspeakers. Hallmarks of the G‑Class include the grab handle in front of the front passenger and the chrome-highlighted switches for the three differential locks. Both have been meticulously optimised and retained as characteristic features.\r\n\r\nThe very clearly arranged and completely redesigned instrument panel features timeless tube-look analogue round dials as standard. In other words, fans of classic round instruments will certainly not be disappointed in the new G‑Class. As in the new E-Class and S-Class, an instrument cluster in the form of a large display showing virtual instruments in the driver\'s direct field of vision and a central display above the centre console is available as an option. In this case the two 12.3-inch displays blend visually into a Widescreen Cockpit beneath a shared glass cover. Drivers can choose between three different styles for the displays – \"Classic\", \"Sport\" and \"Progressive\" – and also select relevant information and views according to their individual needs.\r\n\r\nThanks to haptic impulses and audible feedback from the on-board speakers, drivers can use the touchpad with controller in the centre console without taking their eyes off the road. The input options are rounded off by shortcut keys in front of the controller for frequently used operating tasks, and by the optional control panel for the driving assistance systems above the rotary light switch. The driver sits up close to the windscreen and enjoys good all-round visibility from behind the wheel.',

Its external appearance has not changed significantly since 1979. Iconic elements continue to serve very specific purposes, now as then, and to give the G‑Class its unique appearance. All these are still found in the new G‑Class: the distinctive door handle and the characteristic closing sound, the robust exterior protective strip, the exposed spare wheel on the rear door and the prominent indicator lights. Extraordinary features like these in concert with the off-roader\'s angular lines define its special look. The enhanced design of the G-Class follows the philosophy of Sensual Purity and at the same time remains true to the character of the original. As a result, the door hinges positioned on the outside and the surface-mounted bonnet are carried over to the new generation. With the latest update, the off-road icon - which has been continually enhanced technically over the decades but visually has hardly changed - is making the leap into a new era – both in terms of technology and form. The new G-Class is 53 mm longer and 121 mm wider and now has even greater presence, on the road as well as in terrain. More than ever, the new G-Class appears to be cast from a single piece. All surfaces have a more taut design and are have more tension, while the surface quality has been taken to an even higher level. This results in narrower, more precise gaps and more harmonious transitions. In addition, the wheel arches and bumpers form a more integral part of the body and thus look less like add-on features.',

The automated test drives in the greater Los Angeles area, and subsequently to the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, concentrated on the assessment of driving behaviour in dense city traffic and on highways.

The Lexus LF-1 adheres to the Japanese tradition of omotenashi, or hospitality, welcoming all who enter with equal enthusiasm. The cockpit is designed to allow the driver to concentrate on the task at hand by removing distracting analog knobs and buttons in favor of motion-activated controls and a minimalist display directly ahead. The front passenger space is far more open, with even fewer controls and a wide unobstructed dashboard. Those in back get the same seats as those in front with expansive legroom and individual display screens for adjusting the climate control or entertainment options.\r\n\r\nThe metallic interior trim is finished in the same champagne-tinted color as the exterior, but with a satin finish for a warmer feel. Accents around the instrument panel and on the steering wheel further enhance the cockpit feel for the driver. Additional metallic accents throughout the interior contrast with the dark Cocoa Bean leather trim and seats covered in Chiffon White perforated leather.\r\n\r\nLighting also plays a key role in the look and feel of the interior. Engaging the start button initiates a dramatic lighting sequence based on which of the several available driving modes is engaged. For a more subtle effect, the wooden door trim has tiny perforations that allow indirect light from miniature LEDs to shine in a variety of colors that complement the overhead lights.',

With conquest rates as high as 80 per cent, the majority of customers are new to the brand. The most important market is Germany, which absorbs about 25 per cent of total production. China is next up, followed by the UK. This success story is set to continue with the arrival of the updated models in March 2018.

In classical BMW style, the geometry of the centre console gravitates clearly towards the driver. The model update treats cars fitted with the seven-speed dual-clutch Steptronic transmission or eight-speed Steptronic to the new electronic selector lever. And the clear visual separation between the instrument panel and centre console makes the instrument panel look as if it is hovering in mid-air, adding further to the sense of spaciousness. The slightly angled surfaces emphasise the elevated seating position, which is a key purchasing criterion for many customers - along with a good all-round view and a clear overview of the car. Large trim finishers with accent strips reaffirm the premium credentials of the BMW 2-Series Active Tourer and BMW 2-Series Gran Tourer.',

The most obvious identifying feature of the new BMW 2-Series Active Tourer and BMW 2-Series Gran Tourer at first glance is their significantly larger kidney grille, which is both taller and wider, and now stretches almost all the way to the headlight units. As a result, it exudes notably more presence and expressiveness. The front apron is dominated by the large air intake, which is split into three sections and bordered by large, C-shaped surrounds in a highgloss black finish. The outer air intakes, meanwhile, house the new optional LED foglamps, further accentuating the cutting-edge, sporty feel.',
