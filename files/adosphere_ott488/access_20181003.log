With its seamless, clear design and colour highlights typical of the brand, it is a pioneer for an avant-garde electric look while representing the design idiom of Progressive Luxury. With respect to quality, safety and comfort the EQC is the Mercedes-Benz among electric vehicles, and highly convincing in the sum of its attributes. These are accompanied by dynamic performance, thanks to two electric motors at the front and rear axles with a combined output of 300 kW. A sophisticated operating strategy enables an electric range of more than 450 km according to NEDC. EQ also offers comprehensive services with Mercedes me, and makes electromobility convenient and suitable for day-to-day motoring. The Mercedes-Benz EQC also symbolises the start of a new mobility era at Daimler.\r\n\r\nAs the first Mercedes-Benz model under the new product and technology brand EQ, the Mercedes-Benz EQC has many trailblazing design details and colour highlights typical of the brand. Both inside and out, the EQC embodies the design idiom of Progressive Luxury. This arises from the combination of a previously unknown beauty, the conscious clash of digital and analogue elements as well as the seamless merging of intuitive and physical design.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of its muscular proportions, the Mercedes-Benz EQC is classed as a crossover SUV. The extended roofline and window layout with a low waistline and the coupé-like roof recess at the rear visually position it between an SUV and an SUV coupé.',

A smooth, elegant and clutter-free theme and efficient use of interior space complements a logical, structured approach applied to the layout of controls for intuitive operation. Materials for the interior were chosen with an ecologically-sensitive focus and are used to create a simple and clean look throughout the car, giving the interior a sleek, light and purified feel. The driver and passenger of the Electric model will also notice there is more room between the front seats. This is achieved via a shift-by-wire push-button drive selector free of mechanical linkage.

A fluid exterior shape and natural air flow channels emphasize aerodynamic body lines and surface volumes. A sporty, hatchback-like profile is inspired by aerodynamic efficiency, complementing the soft lines and surfaces that trace the car’s outline. These attributes combine to boost aerodynamics further, which, when combined with various other smart efficiency solutions, produce an industry-leading 0.24 coefficient of drag. In addition to Ioniq aerodynamics, further design details distinguish the Hybrid and Plug-in Hybrid from the Electric models, creating their unique identities.',

The front sports an aggressive new front fascia with standard LED low-beam headlights, while the rear features new taillights, a new bumper, and chrome accents.\r\n\r\nThe new front bumper incorporates larger fog light housings, fully integrated into the bumper, giving the 2019 Pilot a more aggressive look. A redesigned grille features a bold interpretation of the Honda \"flying wing\" grille design, with its chrome band extending above the headlights. Further emphasizing the off-road aggressiveness is a new \"skid\" garnish on the lower portion of the front bumper.\r\n\r\nAvailable fog lights are now LED, the turn signal is thinner, and Honda Pilot Elite models benefit from multi-element full LED headlights, including high beams. Additionally, Pilot Elite models receive power folding mirrors with automatic dimming.\r\n\r\nThe rear receives new taillights with amber turn signals and LED backup lights. A chrome strip on the rocker extends along the side of the vehicle, wrapping around the rear bumper and highlighting the lower bumper\'s skid-type design. Wheels are also more ruggedly styled, with 18-inch designs on LX, EX and EX-L, and an aggressive new 20-inch design on Touring and Elite trims.\r\n\r\nA hands-free power tailgate is available for the first time on Pilot on Touring and Elite grades. With the remote key fob in their pocket or handbag, the driver simply kicks their foot under a designated area of the rear bumper. The tailgate then opens without the owner needing to use their hands--very useful for occasions when their hands are full.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its numerous technology upgrades (described below), updates to Pilot\'s interior include new trim around the vents, available 3-way heated front seats, and wider fold-down armrests for the driver and front passenger. Additionally, second-row captain\'s chairs are now available on both Touring and Elite models (previously Elite only) and second-row retractable sunshades are available on EX-L, Touring and Elite grades.',

They have resulted in the highest levels of perceived quality and refinement, a more driver-oriented interior and an enhanced feeling of total control.\r\nEntering the car, the striking new steering wheel is the first thing drivers will notice. It echoes the design of Nissan\'s newest models globally, including the all-new Micra and the new X-Trail, and is standard across the Qashqai range. Now D-shaped, the horizontal base means easier entry and exit for the driver, as well as providing a more sporty look and feel.\r\nThe steering wheel\'s compact central hub is smaller than before and the three spokes are slimmer, creating an upper space that\'s larger by 17% to improve instrument visibility. The four-way controllers for the combimeter display (left spoke) and cruise control (right spoke) are new, and offer customers more intuitive use and reduced \'eyes off the road\' time.',

If the two radar sensors at the rear detect a vehicle located in the blind spot or approaching quickly from behind, a warning LED is lit in the relevant exterior mirror.\r\n\r\nThe Audi Q3 makes maneuvering easier thanks to functions such as the park assist. It steers the SUV automatically into and out of parking spaces. The driver only has to accelerate, brake and shift gears. If the driver wants to reverse out of a parallel parking space or a tight entrance, cross traffic assist is activated. The system monitors the area behind the vehicle using two radar sensors and alerts the driver in critical situations. The four 360 degree cameras provide another useful function. They show on the large infotainment screen the immediate surroundings of the Audi Q3 when moving at speeds up to 10 km/h (6.2 mph). Touch operation allows the driver to switch between various views. In addition to the virtual bird’s eye view, the reversing camera view and the front and rear 180° panoramic view, there is a detailed view of the front and rear wheels.
