Renegade was also the first Jeep SUV to be built in Italy, at the Melfi SATA Plant. From the beginning, Jeep Renegade gained a footing in this crowded market segment, becoming a favourite of customers seeking a SUV capable of blending the unmatched off-road capabilities of the Jeep brand with dimensions and styling that are perfect for enjoying the city lifestyle. Jeep Renegade embodies all these features and expresses them in its unmistakable Jeep design, its iconic seven-slot grille and a look designed to suggest strength and solidity. With the Renegade, the Jeep brand product offering extends to all market segments allowing everyone to find the SUV they are looking for, with no need to compromise.\r\n\r\nToday, Jeep Renegade is being renewed – building on the strengths which drove it to change a market crowded by crossovers and become the model that has delivered record-breaking sales for the Jeep brand in Europe. Today, its safety equipment is even more comprehensive and the infotainment systems are cutting edge. True to Jeep philosophy, the new Renegade goes beyond limits and offers a new engine range developed to ensure maximum fuel efficiency and outstanding performance both on and off-road. New three and four-cylinder turbo petrol engines debut on the new Jeep Renegade – the new engine family includes a 1.0-liter delivering 120 hp and 190 Nm of torque and a 1.3-liter delivering 150 hp or 180 hp and 270 Nm of torque. The engine offering also includes the updated 1.6-liter and 2.0-liter MultiJet II diesel engines with SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction), all are Euro 6/D compliant. The engine range on the new 2019 Renegade can be paired with a six-speed manual, DDCT (Dual Dry Clutch Transmission) and nine-speed automatic transmissions for a smooth, comfortable driving experience.',

And now the second generation of the successful compact car is rolling to the starting line. Its dynamic design characterizes the new Audi A1 Sportback. It is the ideal companion in the urban environment and is also very well suited for longer journeys. With its infotainment and driver assistance systems on a par with the full-size class, the A1 Sportback is firmly networked with the digital world. New trim lines provide ample opportunity for customization. The Audi A1 Sportback has grown significantly in length - with an additional 56 millimeters (2.2 in), it now measures 4.03 meters (13.2 ft). At the same time, the width has remained almost the same at 1.74 (5.7 ft) meters. The new-generation model is only 1.41 meters (4.6 ft) in height - including aerial, the car is 1.43 meters (4.7 ft) tall. The wide track and short overhangs provide for a taut, sporty look. The wide, low-placed Singleframe grille and the implied side air inlets dominate the distinctive front. Below the edge of the hood are three flat slits - an homage to the Sport quattro, the brand\'s rally icon from 1984. The new Audi A1 Sportback also emphasizes a resemblance to the Audi Ur-quattro and Sport quattro when viewed from the side: The wide, flat sloping C-pillar seems to push the car forward even while standing still. The roof contrast line, which is available in two dark colors, ends above the C-pillar. This gives the impression that the roof is flatter and the complete car is even lower-slung. All lines on the flanks, from the window edge to the sill, slope upward toward the rear in a wedge shape. The distinctively highlighted wheels and the low shoulder line in between give the A1 Sportback a solid stance on the road.

The RX created the luxury crossover segment 20 years ago and has reigned supreme as the most popular luxury utility vehicle on the market. The 2018 RX 350L and RX 450hL models retain their stylish figures, but now offer the choice of six or seven-passenger capability.\r\n\r\nWith the new Lexus RX L models, Lexus drivers will now have the option of a third row without compromising the sleek styling and easy maneuverability that they have long valued. With help through the mastery of vehicle packaging, Lexus extended the body length 4.3 inches (110 mm) at the rear and used a steeper tailgate window angle than on the two-row models - ensuring good headroom for third-row passengers.\r\n\r\nThe standard seven-seat version uses a 40/20/40 split bench-type second row seat. Access to the third row is made easy with the touch of a lever that slides and folds the second seat forward. The available six-seat configuration features second-row captain\'s chairs that make third-row ingress/egress easier with \"walk-in\" convenience.\r\n\r\nLexus designed the third row of the RX L models to offer the same comfort and luxury as in the middle row. The positioning of the second row is slightly higher than the third row, creating more foot room for rear passengers. Standard leather-trimmed upholstery is standard for the first and second rows, in the choice of Black, Stratus Gray, Parchment or Noble Brown. A tri-zone climate control system gives third-row passengers separate heating and air conditioning vents, and for convenience, a power-folding third-row seat and power tailgate are both standard on the RX L models.',

To facilitate this, the students invited SKODA customers and fans to submit suggestions via different social media channels. In the end, Sunroq was chosen from among several hundred proposed names – the students found that it suited their cabriolet perfectly given its openness to the sun, which makes it an ideal vehicle for a summer holiday. The author of the winning submission was invited to the SUNROQ’s official presentation.

More than just an engineering achievement, the GA-K platform gave the designers the flexibility to create an ES that\'s as visibly striking as it is enjoyable to drive. The result is an ES sedan that is longer (+2.6 in / 65 mm), lower (-0.2 in / 5 mm) and wider (+1.8 in / 45 mm) than before with wheels that have been pushed closer to the corners thanks to a two-inch longer wheelbase and wider tracks front (+0.4 in / 10 mm) and rear (+1.5 in / 37 mm).

With its pure concept and historically accurate execution, the 911 Speedster concept reflects the brand essence of the Stuttgart-based sports car manufacturer with precise clarity. A pure driving experience is the main emphasis of the car. The drive technology under the two-tone shell of the concept study is derived from the current GT models. It was developed at the Porsche Motorsport Centre, which is the birth place of the 911 GT2 RS and, most recently, the GT3 RS. The 911 Speedster Concept celebrated its world premiere as part of the official ‘70 years Porsche sportscar’ anniversary celebrations in Zuffenhausen. The concept study offers a glimpse of a potential series-production version, although this model may not be presented until 2019.

Among other features, Insight EX adds an 8-inch Display Audio with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, while Insight Touring adds leather seating surfaces, an 8-way power driver\'s seat, Honda Satellite-Linked Navigation System, dual-zone automatic climate control, and more.\r\n\r\nThe 2019 Insight is powered by the third generation of Honda\'s innovative two-motor hybrid drivetrain. A 1.5-liter DOHC i-VTEC Atkinson-cycle inline-4 engine with 40.5-percent thermal efficiency is paired to an electric propulsion motor that produces 197 lb.-ft. of torque for a class-leading total system output of 151 horsepower. Thanks to its clever two-motor design, Insight operates without the need for a conventional automatic transmission.\r\n\r\nInsight helps drivers maximize energy regeneration through the use of steering wheel-mounted Deceleration Selectors. Working similar to transmission paddle shifters, Insight\'s Deceleration Selectors let the driver toggle between three different levels of regenerative braking performance. Tap the left selector to increase regenerative braking, and the right to reduce it. This system not only increases battery charging via regeneration, it also helps reduce stress on the brakes, and lets drivers tailor their regenerative braking level for different driving conditions.',

GTI Interior Design',thumbnail='http://ott.planetcast.in/p/108/sp/10800/thumbnail/entry_id/0_tqgr8j7m/version/100002',longdescription='It is the small GTI that enables younger drivers to fulfil a dream, and those who are perhaps not-so-young to rekindle old memories: 42 years after the first Golf GTI made its debut, the new Volkswagen up! GTI is here. The concept and power output of the 85 kW / 115 PS up! GTI are broadly in line with the Volkswagen Golf GTI Mk1 unveiled in 1976 with 81 kW / 110 PS. As a compact bundle of power, the new up! GTI pays tribute to this icon - with crisp dimensions, low weight, a powerful and fuel-efficient engine (WLTP consumption: combined 5.7 to 5.6 l/100 km), greater downforce on the rear axle, sports running gear and the typical insignia of a GTI (including red stripes in the radiator grille, red brake callipers and \"clark\" tartan seat covers). The 196 km/h sports car brings a new dimension in driving fun to the small car class, thus creating a clear link back to the original compact Golf GTI. One typical GTI element is the finely tuned sports running gear. It gives the car the agility of a go-kart, while simultaneously providing a high level of comfort. The GTI is in addition the first up! to come with a petrol particulate filter. With this catalytic converter system the Volkswagen up! GTI fulfils the new European Euro AG emissions standard. However, the most powerful of all up! models remains affordable. As was the case with the Golf GTI Mk1, so too with the new up! GTI: high performance does not mean high prices. In Germany, home of the inventor of the GTI, the product line\'s top model is available, for example, for €16,975 - including sports running gear (15 mm lower body), air conditioning, ambient lighting, redesigned 17-inch (\"Brands Hatch\") alloy wheels and infotainment system.',

Its instantly recognisable, trademark \'X\' frontal design and the broad range of customisation options it offered ensured that it always stood out from the crowd.\r\n\r\nAppealing to a more style-conscious audience than those who buy their cars for purely rational reasons, the AYGO\'s striking good looks and engaging driving characteristics made it one of the best-performing Toyota models for attracting new buyers and conquest sales.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Toyota AYGO was amongst the top sellers of the A-segment with more than 85,000 units sold, and a segment share of 6.6%.\r\n\r\nThe new AYGO further strengthens the model\'s unique DNA and stand-out positioning within the highly-competitive A-segment. Toyota\'s designers and engineers have not only reinforced its youthful and distinctive image, but also made the powertrain more efficient and improved the car\'s performance and handling characteristics to make it even more fun to drive.',
