It has been shot by director Kevin Macdonald, whose credits include ‘The Last King of Scotland,’ the Whitney Houston biopic ‘Whitney’ and the Oscar-winning documentary ‘One Day in September’. This world-first collaboration between AI and a renowned craftsman aimed to test the boundaries of how humans and machines can work together in perfect harmony, exploring the importance of intuition in the relationship between the two to showcase the responsive features of the new Lexus ES executive sedan. The result is an engaging short drama: a minute-long film telling the story of a Lexus Takumi Master Craftsman who completes his painstaking work and releases the new Lexus ES into the world, only for it to be taken away and threatened with destruction. At the crucial moment, the car’s automatic emergency braking system cuts in to save the day, demonstrating the value and effectiveness of the intuitive technology built into the car. ',

The background to this was that Porsche discovered irregularities in the engine control software, in the course of internal investigations, and proactively communicated this to the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA). The authority has ordered an adjustment by means of a software update within the scope of a recall. In the middle of October 2017 the KBA has given its approval for the software update for vehicles of the type Cayenne 3.0 litre V6 diesel vehicle of the Euro 6 emission class submitted by Porsche for review. Since that Porsche is bringing all affected vehicles in to garages to perform the software update, which is free of charge. In more specific terms, customers have been informed already by their Porsche dealer, and requested to co-operate with the plans by agreeing to an appointment at a garage. The software update will then take approximately one hour to complete there. Where required, the Porsche centre will be happy to provide an appropriate form of transport as a replacement while the required work is being carried out.',

With a completely newly developed engine and suspension, engine output increased by 6 kW (8 hp) to 152 kW (207 hp) (in the USA: 151 kW (205 hp)) and a weight reduction of 208 kg to 197 kg (193.5 kg with M Package), the supersports bike originally launched in 2009 now goes into its third completely new generation. In addition to enhanced performance, other focus points were to make the new RR at least one second faster than its predecessor, create a more user-friendly design and ensure it offered maximum controllability and ridability. Whether in everyday use, on winding country roads or for high-performance race track riding – the new RR leaves nothing to be desired. In particular because BMW Motorrad has moved the assistance systems such as traction and wheelie control, ABS and Hill Start Control to a whole new level; the same applies to the LED lighting system and large TFT screen.',

For more than 25 years, BMW Motorrad has used 4-valve technology in this connection, combined with electronic fuel injection and closed-loop catalytic converter technology in order to achieve the best possible power and torque delivery, efficiency and environmental compatibility.\r\n\r\nFurther advanced boxer engine with BMW ShiftCam Technology for an additional increase in power across the entire engine speed range, reduced emission and fuel consumption levels, optimised running smoothness and refinement.\r\nWith the extensively further advanced boxer engine, the new R 1250 R, R 1250 GS and R 1250 GS Adventure not only achieve a whole new level of power and torque. It was also possible to significantly optimise refinement and running smoothness – especially within the lower engine speed range. What is more, the new engine offers improved emission and fuel consumption levels as well as a particularly satisfying sound. For this purpose, BMW ShiftCam Technology has been used for the first time in the serial production of BMW Motorrad engines: this enables variation of the valve timings and valve stroke on the intake side. In addition, the intake camshafts are designed for asynchronous opening of the two intake valves, resulting in enhanced swirl of the fresh, incoming mixture and therefore more effective combustion. Other technical changes to the engine relate to the camshaft drive – now taken care of by a toothed chain (previously a roller chain) – an optimised oil supply, twin-jet injection valves and a new exhaust system.',
