China is currently ranked as the largest market for all-electric vehicles, though countries like the US and Norway are also growing considerably, often triggered by government incentives such as subsidies and exemption from toll and parking fees. \r\n\r\nAccording to recent reports by ‘The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders’ (SMMT), many British drivers are still mistrustful or confused when it comes to pure electric cars. Research has shown that more than 52% of consumers are interested in purchasing electric cars, but hesitate due to concerns such finding a charging spot, or not feeling like they know enough about how an EV actually works. \r\n\r\nAs a result, Jaguar has teamed up with Presenter and Creator of Fully Charged Show Robert Llewelyn, to help customers realise the benefits and simplicity of actually owning an electric vehicle.
