These are then used for detailed examinations of innovations, new materials and bonding technologies. Until now, vehicles have had to be dismantled for analysis, but CT allows checks to be carried out with the vehicle completely intact.

We can now analyse our prototypes in minute detail without having to dismantle them first. The new system allows us to examine our vehicles in a way that wouldn\'t be possible with conventional, static computer tomography systems.

The large SUV - named after the Mediterranean city of Tarragona, a historic cultural centre with a spirit that is young and adventurous - completes the Barcelona-based manufacturer\'s SUV range.\r\n\r\nThe latest vehicle designed and developed at the facilities of SEAT in Martorell (Barcelona) and produced in Wolfsburg (Germany), marks the third instalment in the company\'s SUV product offensive and shows a glimpse of the future design language of new SEAT models. Tarraco is the new flagship model of the brand and will bring the company new customers, boost brand image and have an important effect on profits, as this is a model with high contribution margins.\r\n\r\nSEAT Tarraco sits at the top of SEAT\'s SUV family, as the bigger brother to both the Ateca and Arona, and mixes state-of-the-art technology, dynamic and agile handling, practicality and functionality with elegant, progressive design. The Tarraco combines the many advantages of its larger dimensions to offer a vehicle that can take on all elements of modern life.\r\n\r\nThe new SUV blends the key attributes of every vehicle in the SEAT range - design and functionality, sportiness and comfort, accessibility and quality, technology and emotion -but in a form that suits a wider variety of lifestyles. The new SEAT Tarraco is designed for drivers who need the usefulness of a five or seven-seater and the practicality of a higher driving position, but are conscious of a vehicle\'s aesthetics and appreciate the Tarraco\'s balance between self-confidence and elegance. That balance is maintained across both available trim levels, SE and Xcellence.',

The two electric motors accelerate the e-tron from 0-60 mph in 5.5 seconds and reach a top speed of 124 mph. The advantage of the electric motor is felt especially in its impressive off-the-line starting performance from a standstill. The maximum drive torque is reached in 250 milliseconds - a performance worthy of a sports car. US horsepower and torque figures will be available closer to launch.\r\n\r\nThe two asynchronous motors (ASM) of the Audi e-tron are especially robust. Their sophisticated cooling concept is designed to keep the temperature level low. Single-stage transmissions transfer the torque to the axles via the differentials. Each motor is supplied by power electronics that act in close consort with the powertrain control unit. When the Audi e-tron is traveling at moderate speeds, in the interest of efficiency it is powered mainly by the rear motor. When coasting, the motors operate free from magnetic drag torque - another strength of ASM technology.\r\n\r\nThe Audi e-tron uses an innovative recuperation system encompassing both electric motors, to boost efficiency. On average, our engineers estimate that this system is responsible for as much as 30 percent of the e-tron\'s range depending on the conditions, terrain and driving style. The electric SUV can recover energy in two ways: by means of coasting recuperation when the driver releases the accelerator, or by means of braking recuperation by depressing the brake pedal. When pressing the brake pedal, the electronic control unit computes within milliseconds how much pressure the system needs to build up for the specific braking process required. A high-performance electric motor supplies the necessary energy. The integrated brake control system is approximately 30 percent lighter than a conventional system thanks to its more compact design. The conventional vacuum pump is no longer needed in this configuration.',

It\'s the third generation of RDX, a perennial top seller in the premium compact SUV segment with cumulative U.S. sales exceeding 370,000 units since its debut in 2006.\r\n\r\nThis third-generation RDX is the first to be designed and engineered in America, with styling design conducted in the Acura Design Studio in Los Angeles, California, and development conducted by the company\'s North America engineering team headquartered in Raymond, Ohio, adjacent to the RDX\'s manufacturing home in East Liberty, Ohio where RDX is produced using domestic and globally-sourced parts.\r\n\r\nIn setting their targets for the design and performance, the U.S. team drew inspiration from both the Acura Precision Concept and Acura Precision Cockpit as well as the pinnacle representation of Acura performance, the NSX supercar. The RDX is the first all-new design drawing from the Concept styling and the advanced Cockpit technology. The RDX team\'s ultimate goal was straightforward: to make the best RDX ever, a vehicle that sets the foundation for an entire new generation of Acura vehicles in terms of styling, performance, premium quality and technology.\r\n\r\nThe RDX redesign features a new-from-the-ground-up, Acura-exclusive platform, a powerful, responsive and efficient new powertrain, and a more spacious, premium and tech-savvy cabin. With its new turbocharged engine, segment-first 10-speed transmission and the newest generation of available Acura Super Handling All-Wheel Drive™ (SH-AWD®), the new RDX is also the quickest, best-handling RDX ever; and with its new longer and wider platform, the 2019 Acura RDX also boasts top-class cabin and cargo space with exceptional comfort, utility and versatility.',
