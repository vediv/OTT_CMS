The world’s most popular classic car exhibition is providing the meeting point for the international classic scene for the 30th time. From 21 to 25 March 2018, it offers the ideal frame to celebrate the landmark birthdays of some outstandingly fascinating models. At Essen, BMW Group Classic is looking back on the debut of the BMW M1 40 years ago. The mid-engined sports car with its timeless design and motor-sport history is one of the milestones in the company’s heritage. Ten years previously, the BMW 2800 CS had already ushered in the era of “large coupés”. These models were similarly the defining representative of their era both on the road and on the race track. BMW M1: Italian styling, Bavarian engine-building artistry. The common feature of the BMW M1 and the brand’s large coupés is their characteristic harmony combining aesthetics and sportiness. The body styling masterminded by Italian designer Giorgio Giugiaro gave the BMW M1 – only 1.14 metres in height – an Italian profile. The car’s inline six-cylinder engine was by contrast a masterpiece from Munich. Just like the vehicle concept, the drive technology was conceived to master the challenges on the race track and meet the requirements for being licensed as a road-going vehicle.',

Like all members of the successful X family, it blends standout driving qualities on any terrain with unrestricted everyday usability. The third generation of the BMW X3 follows in its predecessors\' tyre tracks by combining rugged off-road looks with a sporting presence. Its familiar proportions, including very short front and rear overhangs, shine the spotlight on the perfect 50:50 distribution of weight between the front and rear axle. The potent dynamic intent of the new BMW X3 is highlighted by a chunky kidney grille and foglamps featuring a hexagonal design for the first time on a BMW X model. At the rear, the light clusters (whose three-dimensional look in optional full-LED guise give them considerable visual impact), markedly downward-sloping roof spoiler and twin exhaust tailpipes bring matters to a suitably muscular conclusion.',
