Championship leader Marc Marquez and teammate Dani Pedrosa had the chance to test the new asphalt and the track’s updated layout before the Italian GP. The run-off area for turn 13 has been worked on, track officials enlarging the run-off area by more than 20 meters while also removing the surrounding grandstands. The bank angle of turn 10 and 11 has also been altered. As it is the case with other six rounds of the season, the Catalan Grand Prix will be shortened in length compared to previous years. This time the race will change from 25 laps to 24. At the Gran Premi de Catalunya Marc Marquez has 2 wins, 1×125 (2010) and 1xMotoGP (2014), plus an additional 5 podiums and 3 pole positions. Dani Pedrosa has 3 wins, 1×125 (2003), 1×250 (2005) and 1xMotoGP (2008), plus an additional 10 podiums and 4 pole positions. Marc and Dani have stood together on the podium on four occasions: in 2013 (Dani 2nd and Marc 3rd), 2014 (Marc 1st and Dani 3rd) in 2016 (Marc 2nd and Dani 3rd), and in 2017 (Marc 2nd and Dani 3rd).',
