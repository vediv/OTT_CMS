The striking styling of the fairing, fuel tank and frame further highlights the focus on the direction of travel.

A fully-electric variant of the Freightliner eM2 106 covers the medium segment (9 to 12 t GVW). Daimler Trucks North America (DTNA) is planning to hand over an innovation fleet of around 30 electric trucks to its first customers in the U.S. in the course of this year. As is already the case with the fully-electric FUSO eCanter light truck and the medium Mercedes-Benz eActros, it is the company\'s objective to gain experience in eTrucks by working together with customers to establish how electric trucks can be efficiently deployed in day-to-day transport operations. With the two e-trucks from Freightliner, the Mercedes-Benz eActros, the FUSO eCanter, the fully-electric Mercedes-Benz Citaro city bus and the Thomas Built Saf-T Liner C2 Jouley school bus, Daimler Trucks & Buses already has the broadest portfolio of fully-electric commercial vehicles to be found anywhere.',

Hankook’s decision to invest in Central Europe rather than the US, Korea or China shows what an important role the European market plays in Hankook’s future growth and development strategy. The new factory, which will be built in the Hungarian city of Dunaujvaros, not only provides the company with missing production capacity close to important sales markets and cheap but highly-skilled workforce, but also goes far beyond the obvious, Seung Hwa Suh, president of Hankook’s European headquarters in Germany, says in an interview with Tyres & Accessories. There are three keywords that Mr Suh frequently uses to describe Hankook’s strategy for Europe and the rest of the world: quality/innovation, service and brand awareness.',

He tells the Newsroom his impressions. 70 years ago, when Ferry Porsche received the approval for the 356 with the number 1, a dream had come true for him. Against all odds, he had created a sports car which was entirely as he had imagined it – and today is considered to be a design icon. The success story of the Porsche company since then is well known and Ferry Porsche’s dream is as alive as ever. The Zuffenhausen-based company still builds sports cars that turn the heads of both small boys and their fathers. I too am proud to say that I am a Porsche owner – a dream come true.',
