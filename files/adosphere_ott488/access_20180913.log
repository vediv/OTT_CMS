The RX created the luxury crossover segment 20 years ago and has reigned supreme as the most popular luxury utility vehicle on the market. The 2018 RX 350L and RX 450hL models retain their stylish figures, but now offer the choice of six or seven-passenger capability.\r\n\r\nWith the new Lexus RX L models, Lexus drivers will now have the option of a third row without compromising the sleek styling and easy maneuverability that they have long valued. With help through the mastery of vehicle packaging, Lexus extended the body length 4.3 inches (110 mm) at the rear and used a steeper tailgate window angle than on the two-row models - ensuring good headroom for third-row passengers.\r\n\r\nThe standard seven-seat version uses a 40/20/40 split bench-type second row seat. Access to the third row is made easy with the touch of a lever that slides and folds the second seat forward. The available six-seat configuration features second-row captain\'s chairs that make third-row ingress/egress easier with \"walk-in\" convenience.\r\n\r\nLexus designed the third row of the RX L models to offer the same comfort and luxury as in the middle row. The positioning of the second row is slightly higher than the third row, creating more foot room for rear passengers. Standard leather-trimmed upholstery is standard for the first and second rows, in the choice of Black, Stratus Gray, Parchment or Noble Brown. A tri-zone climate control system gives third-row passengers separate heating and air conditioning vents, and for convenience, a power-folding third-row seat and power tailgate are both standard on the RX L models.',

Providing the ideal prerequisites for optimum driving stability and higher cornering speeds. At 3150 millimetres, the wheelbase is also longer than in many midsize pickups. This reduces vibrations during the journey and makes for smooth and reliable straight-line stability.\r\n\r\nThe robust ladder-type frame forms the basis for heavy-duty transport loads and tough off-road assignments. The comfort suspension is designed in such a way that it achieves a high level of vehicle dynamics and ride comfort on a par with Mercedes-Benz passenger cars on the road, while also delivering maximum off-road capability in conjunction with 4MATIC all-wheel drive.\r\nA double-wishbone axle at the front ensures a high level of vehicle dynamics, good comfort in terms of road roar and tyre vibrations, and maximum off-road capability. The anti-roll bar reduces body roll. Because the front axle is decoupled, the independent wheel suspension minimises the vibrations which are transferred to the vehicle body, making the steering and noise level comfortable. Located precisely and with comfort firmly in mind thanks to its five links, the rear axle provides traction on even the toughest of off-road terrain. There is plenty of ground clearance as the axle housing is raised as soon as a wheel drives over an obstacle. Because the axle has good articulation capability and spring travel is long, the contact between the ground and the wheels is as good as it can be. Due to the exceptional rigidity of this design, particularly precise wheel control and a high level of driving comfort are assured on the road.\r\n\r\nBoth axles are fitted with coil springs, which helps balance the comfort of the suspension. The suspension struts on the front axle are connected with the ladder-type frame by means by a head bearing. Damping forces are transmitted via a piston rod to a flexible rubber mount in the head bearing and subsequently to the ladder-type frame. The rubber mount\'s design is therefore optimised for comfort. Dampers on the rear axle are attached directly to the ladder-type frame via a support bushing. The shock absorbers are designed to be flexible in generating counter-balancing forces. During normal driving on flat roads and when driving slowly off-road, the system responds softly. With a sporty driving style or sudden evasive manoeuvres, the dampers become stiffer for good driving stability.',

Its maximum torque of 550 Nm is available over a wide engine speed range from 1400 to 3200 rpm. This means that high torque is already available from low engine speeds. Whether for a sporty driving style, comfortable long-distance touring, or off-road driving in difficult conditions – the V6 always ensures serene and efficient progress. Its special features include lightweight design, the single-stage turbocharger with variable turbine geometry for particularly agile engine response, and the innovative NANOSLIDE® cylinder liner coating also used in Formula 1.\r\n\r\nThe 7G-TRONIC PLUS automatic transmission included as standard, complete with steering wheel shift paddles, operates with no interruption in tractive power during gearchanges. This improves the handling on gradients, in off-road terrain, and when towing a trailer. Further advantages include fast shift operation and a low engine speed level. This has a positive effect especially with regard to efficiency and noise levels. The wide gear spacing allows an individual driving experience via the DYNAMIC SELECT system.

This will mark the start of a new era for the BMW Group in which drivers will increasingly be able to operate their car and access its functions and information simply by speaking. The personal assistant will also be able to assist the driver outside their vehicle, whether it’s at home with the help of a smart speaker or out and about via smartphone. What\'s more, he will be compatible with other digital voice assistants beyond Amazon Alexa, too, providing a link to other rapidly growing ecosystems. The personal assistant’s capabilities are developing all the time courtesy of BMW’s Open Mobility Cloud and the use of artificial intelligence. The range of functions and skills available will be constantly expanded as part of regular updates, which can be carried out seamlessly on a smartphone and in-car by Remote Software Upgrade. “BMW’s Intelligent Personal Assistant teams up with the new BMW Operating System 7.0 to create a brand new, digital form of interaction with the customer’s BMW that redefines the whole driving experience,” says Dieter May, Senior Vice President Digital Products BMW Group.',

All-electric operation ensures the roof opens or closes in an almost silent hush, within 15 seconds and while travelling at up to 50 km/h, if required. The broad, wide-opening lid guarantees an emotionally-engaging driving experience shaped in no small part by the sun and on-rushing air.\r\nThe BMW i8 Roadster is alone among its rivals in offering owners a fabric soft-top which stows away into a perpendicular position in the rear when opened and therefore takes up very little space. The three segments of the roof fold vertically in a Z. And between the roof box and the seats for the driver and front passenger is around 100 litres of additional storage space. Together with the load area in the rear, which can accommodate 88 litres of cargo, the rear compartment helps to ensure the open-top version of the plug-in hybrid sports car is also as well equipped as possible for everyday use and trips away.\r\nOpening the roof raises the rear window automatically by around 30 millimetres into a comfort position. This allows it to mimic the effect of a conventional draught stop in reducing air turbulence inside the cabin and ensuring those on board can enjoy the pleasure of open-top driving pleasure in comfort. The driver can adjust the height of the rear window at the touch of a button and thus control the impact of the inflowing\r\nair as desired.\r\nIntelligent lightweight design and innovative production technology also play a key role in the construction of the soft-top. For example, aluminium elements connecting the roof mechanism with the body of the new BMW i8 Roadster are produced in a new 3D printing process. This manufacturing method for aluminium components breaks new ground in the automotive industry and allows the topologically optimised bracings to be produced in a geometric form, which would not be possible using conventional casting techniques and ensures an optimum balance between component rigidity and weight.\r\n',

It was also the year that Mazda unveiled the RX-7, a car that played a vital role in establishing Mazda’s reputation for building celebrated driver’s cars.\r\n\r\nIn the 1970s car makers the world over found themselves faced with the grim reality of a global fuel crisis. Soaring petrol prices meant few drivers wanted to own big, gas-guzzling V8 sports cars, so a new approach was needed. Responding to the challenging environment, Mazda’s brightest brains set about creating a new kind of sports car – one that would be smaller, lighter, more efficient and – most important of all – fun to drive.\r\n\r\nSo in the home market of Japan, Mazda revealed the ground-breaking RX-7. Its compact yet powerful rotary engine allowed the power unit to be mounted lower and further back resulting in a car that set new standards in road holding. The formula was a hit with customers and critics alike. Car and Driver magazine, one of America’s most influential car magazines, placed the Mazda RX-7 on its annual Ten Best list five times.',

Its maximum torque of 550 Nm is available over a wide engine speed range from 1400 to 3200 rpm. This means that high torque is already available from low engine speeds. Whether for a sporty driving style, comfortable long-distance touring, or off-road driving in difficult conditions – the V6 always ensures serene and efficient progress. Its special features include lightweight design, the single-stage turbocharger with variable turbine geometry for particularly agile engine response, and the innovative NANOSLIDE cylinder liner coating also used in Formula 1.\r\n\r\nThe 7G-TRONIC PLUS automatic transmission included as standard, complete with steering wheel shift paddles, operates with no interruption in tractive power during gearchanges. This improves the handling on gradients, in off-road terrain, and when towing a trailer. Further advantages include fast shift operation and a low engine speed level. This has a positive effect especially with regard to efficiency and noise levels. The wide gear spacing allows an individual driving experience via the DYNAMIC SELECT system.

With its infotainment and driver assistance systems on a par with the full-size class, the A1 Sportback is firmly networked with the digital world. New trim lines provide ample opportunity for customization. The Audi A1 Sportback has grown significantly in length - with an additional 56 millimeters (2.2 in), it now measures 4.03 meters (13.2 ft). At the same time, the width has remained almost the same at 1.74 (5.7 ft) meters. The new-generation model is only 1.41 meters (4.6 ft) in height - including aerial, the car is 1.43 meters (4.7 ft) tall. The wide track and short overhangs provide for a taut, sporty look. The wide, low-placed Singleframe grille and the implied side air inlets dominate the distinctive front. Below the edge of the hood are three flat slits - an homage to the Sport quattro, the brand\'s rally icon from 1984. The new Audi A1 Sportback also emphasizes a resemblance to the Audi Ur-quattro and Sport quattro when viewed from the side: The wide, flat sloping C-pillar seems to push the car forward even while standing still. The roof contrast line, which is available in two dark colors, ends above the C-pillar. This gives the impression that the roof is flatter and the complete car is even lower-slung. All lines on the flanks, from the window edge to the sill, slope upward toward the rear in a wedge shape. The distinctively highlighted wheels and the low shoulder line in between give the A1 Sportback a solid stance on the road.

The BMW 8-Series Coupe is a dream car boasting outstanding performance, emotion-stirring design, state-of-the-art luxury and exceptionally advanced equipment features when it comes to display and control technology, driver assistance and connectivity.\r\n\r\nThe worldwide market launch of the new BMW 8-Series Coupe will commence in November 2018. The sports car will be built at the BMW Dingolfing plant, which is also home to the BMW 7-Series sedans meaning that it has acquired tremendous expertise in the manufacture of luxury vehicles. The digit 8 in the model name is indicative of the newcomer\'s high-ranking status within BMW\'s product range. As in the past with the BMW Z8 and also with the current BMW i8, it is reserved for exceptionally sporty cars that fire the emotions. The BMW 8-Series Coupe will therefore be a key component of the luxury segment model offensive set out by the BMW Group as part of its NUMBER ONE > NEXT strategy.\r\n\r\nThe primary development objective for the new BMW 8-Series Coupe was thrilling driving dynamics. Body, powertrain and suspension were consistently honed to achieve the supreme agility, precision and poise expected of a top-class sports car. In the process, remarkably powerful engines were combined with the BMW xDrive intelligent all-wheel-drive system and BMW EfficientLightweight design measures. The new BMW 8-Series Coupe was developed in parallel to the BMW M8 GTE, which had already proven its potential in the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) long-distance races and in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC) held in North America. The production car now makes it possible to experience outstandingly dynamic performance in an exceedingly luxurious setting.',
