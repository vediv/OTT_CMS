The dashboard support flows into the door panels, and the integral trim element likewise extends around the driver and front passenger to meet the doors. As in the luxury-class saloons, this greatly accentuates the impression of width while conveying security and elegance. At the same time it creates the impression that the upper cockpit section is free-floating.\r\n\r\nThe instrument cluster and media display (2 x 12.3-inch as standard) are housed behind a shared, continuous glass surface to form a large, free-standing screen. There is a touchpad in the centre console as a further means of controlling many vehicle functions. The ambience lighting impressively illuminates the dashboard, with optical fibres coursing throughout the cockpit. The four rectangular air vents are prominently embedded in the trim element.\r\n\r\nThe prominent, raised centre console creates a robust contrast with the flee-floating appearance of the dashboard. As a typical feature of off-roaders, there are two prominent grab handles on the centre console. They are lined with leather, and not only provide a firm grip but are also pleasant to the touch. The modern, luxurious impression is rounded off by the flowing leather surface behind them, the large trim element and the flush-fitted roller blind.',

The infotainment system has larger screens, a full-colour head-up display with a resolution of 720 x 240 pixels and the MBUX Interior Assistant, which can recognise hand and arm movements and supports operating intentions. The exterior design not only exudes presence and power, but also sets a new standard for aerodynamics in the SUV segment. The GLE will receive a completely new range of engines on market launch in early 2019. The new 4MATIC ensures great agility on the road and superior performance off the beaten track.

The vehicle\'s proportions with a long wheelbase, short overhangs and large, flush-fitted wheels already leave no doubt that it feels at home and cuts a good figure on any terrain.\r\n\r\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLE follows the design strategy of sensual purity, and dispenses with individual edges and beading in favour of generously modelled surfaces. The surfaces interact with precise graphic elements.\r\n\r\nThe aesthetic appeal of the Mercedes-Benz GLE is based on the harmonious interaction between emotion and intelligence, which is designed to awaken desire. This is characterised by timeless beauty, a combination of high-grade technology and craftsmanship and reduction to what is really important.\r\n\r\nThe front section of the GLE exudes presence and power: this is ensured by the upright radiator grille in an octagonal SUV interpretation, the prominent, chrome-plated underguard and the bonnet with two powerdomes. This striking appearance is emphasised by the distinctive headlamp design by day and night.\r\n\r\nViewed from the side, the wide C-pillar typical of the GLE conveys self-assured stability. The striking, dark wheel arch claddings and the new, larger wheels in sizes 18 to 22 inches clearly emphasise the SUV character of the vehicle, and ensure a powerful presence. The pillared roof rails or the optional illuminated running boards likewise confirm the robust SUV character of the vehicle. The chrome surrounds of the windows are however reminiscent of a premium saloon model.\r\n\r\nThe sporty and athletic appearance of the GLE is continued into the rear end. This is particularly ensured by the powerful shoulder muscle extending from the C-pillar to the rear lights. The reflectors are relocated lower down, giving the rear lights a flatter appearance. They are also in two sections. This not only gives an impression of width, but also creates an unmistakable night design with illuminated blocks typical of Mercedes-Benz SUVs, in this case with backlit edge lighting. The rear is strikingly rounded off with the chrome-plated underguard.',

There is a choice of efficient gasoline engines with outputs ranging from 70 kW (95 hp) to 147 kW (200 hp). Turbocharging, direct injection and a particulate filter are standard.\r\n\r\nAudi is making a manual transmission or the seven-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission available for all engines. The exception is the top-of-the-range engine, where a six-speed S tronic transmission shifts gear as standard.',

At the same time, the width has remained almost the same at 1.74 (5.7 ft) meters. The new-generation model is only 1.41 meters (4.6 ft) in height - including aerial, the car is 1.43 meters (4.7 ft) tall. The wide track and short overhangs provide for a taut, sporty look. The wide, low-placed Singleframe grille and the implied side air inlets dominate the distinctive front. Below the edge of the hood are three flat slits - an homage to the Sport quattro, the brand\'s rally icon from 1984.\r\n\r\nThe new Audi A1 also emphasizes a resemblance to the Audi Ur-quattro and Sport quattro when viewed from the side: The wide, flat sloping C-pillar seems to push the car forward even while standing still. The roof contrast line, which is available in two dark colors, ends above the C-pillar. This gives the impression that the roof is flatter and the complete car is even lower-slung. All lines on the flanks, from the window edge to the sill, slope upward toward the rear in a wedge shape. The distinctively highlighted wheels and the low shoulder line in between give the A1 Sportback a solid stance on the road. The low line between the fender edges draws the visual focal point downward even further.',

The dashboard support flows into the door panels, and the integral trim element likewise extends around the driver and front passenger to meet the doors. As in the luxury-class saloons, this greatly accentuates the impression of width while conveying security and elegance. At the same time it creates the impression that the upper cockpit section is free-floating.\r\n\r\nThe instrument cluster and media display (2 x 12.3-inch as standard) are housed behind a shared, continuous glass surface to form a large, free-standing screen. There is a touchpad in the centre console as a further means of controlling many vehicle functions. The ambience lighting impressively illuminates the dashboard, with optical fibres coursing throughout the cockpit. The four rectangular air vents are prominently embedded in the trim element.\r\n\r\nThe prominent, raised centre console creates a robust contrast with the flee-floating appearance of the dashboard. As a typical feature of off-roaders, there are two prominent grab handles on the centre console. They are lined with leather, and not only provide a firm grip but are also pleasant to the touch. The modern, luxurious impression is rounded off by the flowing leather surface behind them, the large trim element and the flush-fitted roller blind.',

The 34-year-old Swiss driver is competing to drive faster than anyone else. The Grand Prix circuit in the Belgian Ardennes is 7.004 kilometers long. Up until now, Britain\'s Lewis Hamilton holds the record, won in a Mercedes F1 W07 Hybrid. His lap, on August 26, 2017, lasted exactly 1:42.553 minutes. The Porsche engineers were not limited by racing regulations for their protégé\'s ride, they were literally able to give their abilities free rein, without braking. In addition to software changes and improvements in aerodynamics and technology, they were able to save 39 kilos compared to the racing version. With a system output of 720 hp, the Evo now weighed in at just 849 kilos.
