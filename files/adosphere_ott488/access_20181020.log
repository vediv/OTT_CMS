It was created in 1927 as a mass start race beginning and ending in Brescia, over a route leading down to Rome and then back up the Italian peninsula that totalled 1600 kilometres, or one thousand imperial miles (\"mille miglia\"). In 1928, during the second edition, Alfa Romeo won both the individual and the team titles, with all eight of its cars successfully completing the course. To celebrate the ninetieth anniversary of the first in a long series of victories, the \"Alfa Romeo: Mille Miglia in 90 places\" project has been created, to retrace the most significant stages in a unique story through ninety photos of the most emblematic locations.\r\nPlaces and episodes that helped to write the long history of Alfa Romeo at the world\'s most famous motorsports race, as a means of extending the passion from legendary models to current production.\r\n\r\nBut before the start itself, no Mille Miglia would be complete without the technical checks yesterday at the showground and the sealing and inspection, which took place this morning in the lovely setting of Piazza della Vittoria, one of main squares of the city known as the \"Lioness of Italy\". The process involves two stages, one for the crews - permits, certificates and driving licences - and one which checks the car\'s technical features. Sealing involves the application of a lead seal to confirm that the inspection has been passed and that the car is as specified in the race documents and, above all, it constitutes final approval to take part in the event.\r\n\r\nBut above all, technical aspects aside, sealing and inspection is one of the times when fans have the opportunity of a close look at the historic cars taking part in the race, and in Brescia all eyes are on the stunning 1928 Alfa Romeo 6C 1500 Super Sport, with coachwork by Farina, which is celebrating the ninetieth anniversary of its memorable victory in the 1928 Mille Miglia. The car will be carrying the race number 30, also borne by the winning car driven by Giuseppe Campari and Giulio Ramponi.',

VAT) and thus remains at the level of the preceding version. The specification includes a host of new features such as the LED headlamps, the driving assistance systems, the high-quality interior with leather seats, and the new suspension.

Alfa Romeo, as always, is the protagonist of the event, especially in this 2018 in which the ninetieth anniversary of the first, mythical, victory occurs. In 1928, in fact, the Alfa Romeo 6C 1500 Sport Spider Zagato triumphed, led by Campari and Ramponi. It was the first of eleven successes, undefeated record, of the Alfa Romeo.\r\n\r\nThis video tells a passion that survives the time, a long history of emotions and fascination that from 1927 to today unfolds in a unique path and the emotion, unchanged, to drive an Alfa Romeo car along tracks impregnated with legend. From the departure of Viale Venezia, a series of evocative places where the landscape intertwines with the experience of driving. An experience, aboard Alfa Romeo, where sportiness plays a leading role.\r\n\r\nThe secret of Alfa Romeo and its uniqueness lie in the wonder that not only arouses historical models, but also the current production that, with Stelvio and Giulia, embodies the new paradigm of the brand. Stelvio is the first SUV in the history of over 100 years of the brand and has rewritten the rules of the category establishing new references in terms of performance, while Giulia is the sports saloon where functional beauty and dynamics combine to achieve the best performance. Innovative engines, distinctly Italian design and unique technical solutions make the SUV and the Berlina two authentic Alfa Romeo cars that catch the eye on the streets of the Mille Miglia and tear applause, thanks to the timeless appeal of the brand.',

The 450 cars accepted to take part in the 2018 Mille Miglia are of 72 different brands, and Alfa Romeo has a very large group, with 47 cars entered from the official and private teams.\r\nAlfa Romeo is the brand which has put its name on the winners\' board more than any other in the race\'s history: it can boast of eleven victories, eleven silver medals, ten third places and nine \"triples\", with its cars taking the top three places. So its bond with the competition is truly unique, and this year\'s is a really special edition, because it coincides with the ninetieth anniversary of the first win.',

Whether smart assistance systems or connectivity packages, Bosch offers many solutions that make roads safer for motorcyclists. And with its innovative research projects, it is already planning for the next stages of development.\r\n\r\nSliding mitigation research project:\r\n\r\nWhether wet leaves, an oil spill, or gravel on the road surface, wheels begin to slip sideways if they can no longer apply sufficient lateral force in a curve. In situations such as these, motorcyclists have practically no chance of righting their bikes. Ideally, keeping them safely on course would require applying additional external lateral force. This is the idea behind the sliding mitigation Bosch is developing in a research project. Like a magic hand, it keeps the motorcycle on track and considerably reduces the risk of a fall. A sensor detects sideways wheel slip. If a certain value is exceeded, gas is released from a gas accumulator of the type used in passenger-car airbags. The gas flows into the tank adapter and is vented in a certain direction through a nozzle. This reverse thrust keeps the motorcycle on track.\r\n\r\nRadar-based assistance systems:\r\n\r\nGiving motorcycles radar as a sensory organ enables these new motorcycle assistance and safety functions while providing an accurate picture of the vehicle’s surroundings. As a result, these assistance functions not only increase safety, they also enhance enjoyment and convenience by making life easier for riders.',

As far as the exterior design goes compared to the also SPA-based V90 and V90 Cross Country, this time around, Volvo could play around a bit more with the light, both in order to break up the mass visually, and to give the 60 models a more dominant stance. This tightened look is a requirement in this segment, not to mention that the V60 is also destined to spawn a Polestar variant sometime in the future. Still, if you ever saw a V90 with the R-Design package in the wild, the V60 won\'t cause a heart attack. While other markets get two diesel options until the world gives up on them for good, Volvo\'s American offering starts with the front-wheel drive T5 (specs to be confirmed) and the all-wheel drive T6. This car packs 310 horsepower and 295 ft.-lbs. of torque, giving it a zero-to-sixty time of 5.8 seconds. Both plug-in hybrids are a full second quicker off the line, with the T6 Twin Engine having a peak output of 340 (253 gas+87 electric) horses and 435 ft.-lbs. of torque. Figures of the the top-of-the-line T8 variant should be familiar too, as this hybrid pushes you forward with 390 horsepower (303+87) and 472 foot-pounds.

As far as the exterior design goes compared to the also SPA-based V90 and V90 Cross Country, this time around, Volvo could play around a bit more with the light, both in order to break up the mass visually, and to give the 60 models a more dominant stance. This tightened look is a requirement in this segment, not to mention that the V60 is also destined to spawn a Polestar variant sometime in the future. Still, if you ever saw a V90 with the R-Design package in the wild, the V60 won\'t cause a heart attack. While other markets get two diesel options until the world gives up on them for good, Volvo\'s American offering starts with the front-wheel drive T5 (specs to be confirmed) and the all-wheel drive T6. This car packs 310 horsepower and 295 ft.-lbs. of torque, giving it a zero-to-sixty time of 5.8 seconds. Both plug-in hybrids are a full second quicker off the line, with the T6 Twin Engine having a peak output of 340 (253 gas+87 electric) horses and 435 ft.-lbs. of torque. Figures of the the top-of-the-line T8 variant should be familiar too, as this hybrid pushes you forward with 390 horsepower (303+87) and 472 foot-pounds.
