Its instantly recognisable, trademark \'X\' frontal design and the broad range of customisation options it offered ensured that it always stood out from the crowd.\r\n\r\nAppealing to a more style-conscious audience than those who buy their cars for purely rational reasons, the AYGO\'s striking good looks and engaging driving characteristics made it one of the best-performing Toyota models for attracting new buyers and conquest sales.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Toyota AYGO was amongst the top sellers of the A-segment with more than 85,000 units sold, and a segment share of 6.6%.\r\n\r\nThe new AYGO further strengthens the model\'s unique DNA and stand-out positioning within the highly-competitive A-segment.

The striking styling of the fairing, fuel tank and frame further highlights the focus on the direction of travel.

The hovering side panel is painted in Pure Metal Silver.

The name can be roughly translated as “lively young horse”, referencing the imagery at the heart of the Porsche crest, which has featured a leaping steed since 1952. “Our new electric sports car is strong and dependable; it’s a vehicle that can consistently cover long distances and that epitomises freedom”, explains Oliver Blume, Chairman of the Executive Board of Porsche AG. The oriental name also signifies the launch of the first electric sports car with the soul of a Porsche. Porsche announced the name for its first purely electric series as part of the “70 years of sports cars” ceremony.\r\n \r\nTwo permanently excited synchronous motors (PSM) with a system output of over 600 hp (440 kW) accelerate the electric sports car to 100 km/h in well under 3.5 sec-onds and to 200 km/h in under twelve seconds. This performance is in addition to a continuous power level that is unprecedented among electric vehicles: Multiple jump starts are possible in succession without loss of performance, and the vehicle’s maxi-mum range is over 500 km in accordance with the NEDC.',

R Pikes Peak, which features two electric engines and a system performance of 500 kW (680 PS), is the sporty figurehead of the future family of electric production cars, which Volkswagen will launch from 2020 onwards. \r\n\r\nThe technicians will focus on final set-up work during the official tests. Up until Sunday, Dumas will use every waking opportunity to bond with his car. The 40-year-old already knows the route like the back of his hand, having already taken outright victory at the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb on three occasions. The stated goal for this year is a new record in the class for electric cars. The current record of 8:57.118 minutes was set in 2016.\r\n',

And now the second generation of the successful compact car is rolling to the starting line. Its dynamic design characterizes the new Audi A1 Sportback. It is the ideal companion in the urban environment and is also very well suited for longer journeys. With its infotainment and driver assistance systems on a par with the full-size class, the A1 Sportback is firmly networked with the digital world. New trim lines provide ample opportunity for customization.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new A1 Sportback also emphasizes a resemblance to the Audi Ur-quattro and Sport quattro when viewed from the side: The wide, flat sloping C-pillar seems to push the car forward even while standing still. The roof contrast line, which is available in two dark colors, ends above the C-pillar. This gives the impression that the roof is flatter and the complete car is even lower-slung.\r\n\r\nWith S line equipment, Audi has emphasized the sporty character even more through numerous features. These include larger air inlets, additional sill trims, an elongated slit centrally below the hood with two fins and the larger rear wing. The top-of-the-line engine is also recognizable with its striking twin tailpipes.\r\n\r\n“The sportiest interior in the compact class,” that was the stated aim of the design. The interior is accordingly driver-focused, with its emotive, customizable design. The eye is drawn in particular to the sporty compact unit of air vent nozzles, hood and the digital instrument cluster. All of the controls and the optional MMI touch display are strongly driver-oriented thus emphasizing the special cockpit character.\r\n',

True to Jeep philosophy, the new Renegade goes beyond limits and offers a new engine range developed to ensure maximum fuel efficiency and outstanding performance both on and off-road.
