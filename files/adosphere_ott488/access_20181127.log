The new BMW Z4 is ready to steal the show as a premium open-top sports car boasting an emotion-packed body design, a fully-electric soft-top roof, compact proportions and a squarely driver-focused interior. Agility, dynamic performance and precise handling were all top priorities when developing the two-seater\'s body, powertrain and chassis. The extremely high rigidity of the body structure and chassis mountings, the intelligent lightweight design and optimised aerodynamic properties provided the ideal basis for meeting these objectives. The new design of the front and rear axles benefits not just the car\'s sporty on-road prowess, but its ride comfort too. And the new BMW Z4 combines its pure sporting pedigree with a wealth of highly advanced, topclass equipment features on the driver assistance, operation and connectivity fronts.\r\n\r\nFrom the outside, the way in which the roadster concept has evolved is particularly plain to see from the car\'s proportions. The new BMW Z4 has a low-slung, sporty, compact appearance when viewed from any angle. It is 85 millimetres longer than its predecessor (at 4,324 millimetres), 74 millimetres wider (now 1,864 millimetres) and 13 millimetres taller (1,304 millimetres). The shortening of the wheelbase by 26 millimetres to 2,470 millimetres serves to sharpen agility, as do the notably wider tracks - 1,609 millimetres at the front (+ 98 mm) and 1,616 millimetres at the rear (+ 57 mm). The car\'s central seating position, low centre of gravity and minimised weight, as well as ideal 50 : 50 weight distribution, also contribute to the intoxicating dynamism of the new BMW Z4.',

The new BMW Z4 is ready to steal the show as a premium open-top sports car boasting an emotion-packed body design, a fully-electric soft-top roof, compact proportions and a squarely driver-focused interior. Agility, dynamic performance and precise handling were all top priorities when developing the two-seater\'s body, powertrain and chassis. The extremely high rigidity of the body structure and chassis mountings, the intelligent lightweight design and optimised aerodynamic properties provided the ideal basis for meeting these objectives. The new design of the front and rear axles benefits not just the car\'s sporty on-road prowess, but its ride comfort too. And the new BMW Z4 combines its pure sporting pedigree with a wealth of highly advanced, topclass equipment features on the driver assistance, operation and connectivity fronts.\r\n\r\nFrom the outside, the way in which the roadster concept has evolved is particularly plain to see from the car\'s proportions. The new BMW Z4 has a low-slung, sporty, compact appearance when viewed from any angle. It is 85 millimetres longer than its predecessor (at 4,324 millimetres), 74 millimetres wider (now 1,864 millimetres) and 13 millimetres taller (1,304 millimetres). The shortening of the wheelbase by 26 millimetres to 2,470 millimetres serves to sharpen agility, as do the notably wider tracks - 1,609 millimetres at the front (+ 98 mm) and 1,616 millimetres at the rear (+ 57 mm). The car\'s central seating position, low centre of gravity and minimised weight, as well as ideal 50 : 50 weight distribution, also contribute to the intoxicating dynamism of the new BMW Z4.',

The next chapter in McLaren’s Ultimate Series, the Speedtail is the first ‘Hyper-GT’ from the pioneering British company recognised for producing luxury sportscars and supercars that deliver extraordinary driving experiences. The Speedtail can achieve the highest maximum speed of any McLaren to date, reaching 403 km/h (250mph), yet will also deliver an unprecedented blend of contemporary craftsmanship, materials innovation and bespoke personalisation. Just 106 will be created and all are already reserved, at a price of from £1.75million plus taxes.\r\n\r\nAs the most powerful and most aerodynamically drag efficient McLaren, the Speedtail can exceed the 243mph record peak speed of the legendary McLaren F1, a feat made possible by intense collaboration between McLaren’s design and engineering teams to deliver a peerless blend of aerodynamic, powertrain and dynamic excellence. It is also significant that this is the first of 18 new cars or derivatives that McLaren will introduce as part of its Track25 business plan.\r\n\r\nThe teardrop-shaped cockpit and aerodynamically optimised body are the foundation for the exceptional aerodynamic drag efficiency, with innovative features such as carbon fibre front-wheel static aero covers, retractable digital rear-view cameras (in lieu of mirrors) and patented active rear ailerons furthering contributing to the ultra-low drag achieved.\r\n\r\nThe Speedtail model is built around a bespoke McLaren Monocage carbon fibre structure and benefits from lightweight engineering throughout, including an all-carbon fibre body, aluminium active suspension and carbon ceramic brakes. The powertrain is a pioneering petrol-electric hybrid developing a combined 1,050PS to support the extraordinary performance.',
