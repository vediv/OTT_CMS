Seated under the open sky, the driver is at the centre of the hustle and bustle of the city, in which, thanks to the electric drive, they can freely participate. The openness and minimalistic style are a tribute to the pioneering smart concept vehicles \"crossblade\" (2001) and \"forspeed\" (2011).\r\n\r\nEveryone knows that smart is practical. That smart is cool. Reduced to the essential, it is uncompromisingly open, pays no heed to convention and is, of course, powered by an electric powertrain. It takes up the original motto of smart, reduce to the max, with a twinkle in its eye, standing for the authentic urban mobility that continues to be the underlying concept behind the brand.\r\n\r\nBoth the smart brand and the smart forease stand for emotionality, lifestyle and attitude. The vehicle owes its unconventional beauty to the opening of the interior to its environment, the absence of a roof and the shorter windscreen. With its radiant, dramatic metallic-white and colour accents in \"stream green\", the smart forease promises a carefree driving experience, freed from convention, yet in harmony with its surroundings.',

The model returns to the limelight at this year’s Geneva Motor Show with Talisman S-Edition, an even sportier limited-edition version. \r\n\r\nBased on the extensively equipped Intens equipment level (ADAS Pack and Vision System, Multi-Sense, massaging seats, etc.), Talisman S-Edition combines sporty styling with exclusive appointments, plus the 4Control Pack and Electronic Damper Control as standard features for an impeccably smooth ride.\r\n\r\nThe S-Edition version’s elegant, exclusive exterior styling is rounded out by the fitment of black Alizarine 19-inch wheels and, for extra privacy, extra-tinted rear glass. The model also comes with Pure Vision Full LED head lights, embossed chrome door sills, S-Edition badging on the wings and Etoilé Black door mirror housings to make refinement even more part of the car’s DNA.\r\n\r\nThe interior of Talisman S-Edition remains subdued despite the addition of such openly sporty features as black leather and red top-stitching for the upholstery and dashboard (plus matching leather-trimmed steering wheel, gear lever bellows and door inserts), grey and red carpet mats with embroidered S-Edition motif, aluminium pedal caps and other ‘aluminium’ finish appointments. The black roof lining brings an additional touch of premium sports appeal. Talisman S-Edition comes with the same spacious cabin, innovative technology and high-quality finish that helped to forge the model’s reputation for excellence.',
